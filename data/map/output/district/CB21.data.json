The main advantage of diffusion bonding is that, unlike welding, it is not a 'fusion' process \u2013 it is a solid state process and the parent materials to be joined do not need to be melted. This makes diffusion bonding an ideal solution for joining materials such as metals to ceramics and Aluminium, Titanium, Nickel, Steel etc.\n\nOther advantages include near-parent properties, minimal shape change to parts and no post-finishing. The key to successful diffusion bonding lies in choosing process conditions which are appropriate to the circumstances, because the joint needs to form successfully with both parent materials, whilst controlling deformation. Joint intimacy and cleanliness are also critical factors.\n\nA reliable NDE method is required for the inspection of the bonds. A non-satisfactory bonding may include voids that will have a negative effect of the integrity of the joint. The challenge in inspecting these bonds is that the joining process will create a multi-layered structure that will complicate the interpretation of the inspection data. In addition to this, the bonding layer will have an irregular surface making most inspection techniques unsuitable.\n\nIt is anticipated that this issue can be solved by developing a phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) method and Full Matrix Capture (FMC), that combined with a material-based model of the multi-layered structure will give an assessment of the diffusion bonding. The model and the tailored inspection data will then be used in signal processing algorithms to extract features of the bonding layer.

They employed finite element modelling of the electron gun to increase beam power, the key to increasing processing speed.\n\nThe prototype was tested in industrial process trials by one project partner, who now has a registered trademark for the EBM technology.

They are normally based on traditional methods where vertical drillings through the soil matrix are used for soil and groundwater sampling and testing for pollution and characterising the geology. A recent development is the use of probes driven down into the soil. The probes can be used for taking out samples of soil, water or air, or direct physical /geotechnical investigation. The sampling method is faster than drilling and can be combined with analytical equipment on the surface, hereby doing online measurements for volatile compounds. The overall aim of the MICCS project is to develop a more advanced in-situ investigation method for identifying and characterising pollution. This will be achieved by integrating more sophisticated sensors (e.g. micro-chips, electrochemical sensors, spectrometry, and optical sensors) into a solid probe intended to drive down through the soil matrix to perform continuous or semi-continuous measurements. The sensor measurements are combined with improved soil radar solutions (GPR) for better positioning and soil structure specification.

Failure to promptly detect cracks once initiated can cause catastrophic accidents with appalling injuries and widespread power cuts.\n\nDuring scheduled outages when the power plants shut down for maintenance and repair, pipelines are inspected with non-destructive testing techniques. The http://www.hotscan.eu/ (HOTSCAN) project received funding under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) to develop a monitoring system that would be permanently installed on pipelines. Once installed during a scheduled outage, the new system would continuously inspect all welds while the plant is in service.\n\nUltrasonic guided wave testing was identified as the most suitable method to detect structural defects and monitor their growth. In particular, guided waves can propagate in cylinders and different elongated structures, enabling inspection of a large area. This technique had been successfully employed at ambient temperatures, but the extremely high temperatures in power plants presented a great challenge for HOTSCAN researchers.\n\nThe long range ultrasonic technique proposed by HOTSCAN researchers is based on an array of transducers placed around a pipe to transmit sound waves and receive the echoes. The transducers were manufactured using a special type of lithium niobate crystal that retains its piezoelectric behaviour at temperatures as high as 600 degrees Celsius. Dedicated software was also developed to analyse the data received from the array of transducers.\n\nThe HOTSCAN system can identify cracks having cross section greater than 1 millimetre. This reduces the probability of a power plant failure due to steam pipe ruptures to below 1 in 10 000. Such continuous inspection of all welds reduces the planned outage time by up to 5%, resulting in significant cost savings.", null, "http://www.plantintegrity.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/144664.jpg", "fp7_107655_985908486"], ["6AL", "\"Design, implementation and validation of an automatic learning cure cycle optimisation process for the eco-efficient autoclave processing of composite materials\"", "Twi Limited", "'Historically, most designers of high quality structural composite components for aerospace applications have taken for granted the need for an autoclave cure.

The use of autoclave has been justified as the highest of material performance standards is required (i.e. void contents of less than 2%, and glass transition temperatures (Tg) above 180oC) and as the required process certification is provided by the tight control of temperature and pressure.

It takes into consideration autoclave dimensions, composite part geometry, materials specifications, the material state models and real temperature data from previous runs.\n\nThe system identification module then calculates the heat transfer algorithm of the autoclave that is needed for the subsequent optimisation step. The heat transfer model is expected to be marketable as a stand-alone component where targets include the automotive and wind energy sectors, in addition to aerospace.\n\nOptimisation takes into account materials and process constraints through a cure profile optimisation algorithm that is also planned to be marketed as a stand-alone version.

Additionally, these anticorrosion primers are often too thick (~50\u03bcm) preventing weld quality, so time consuming localised grinding is done to remove the primer.

Researchers are also improving it to yield higher purity products for significantly higher value and thus appeal. A solvent selection tool developed by researchers is aiding in determination of the best potential solvents for given complex waste streams.\n\nAlthough EPS from construction materials will be part of the waste stream in the near future, at this time EPS from fish boxes is the most readily available waste stream. PC composites found in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) contain glass fibres, difficult to recycle mechanically due to machine abrasion and thus particularly well-suited to solvent-based recycling. Scientists have screened various solvents of these materials for performance, safety and environmental impact.\n\nThe life-cycle assessment plan is in place and the team has consulted with experts regarding the need to decontaminate plastics from legacy additives currently banned but sure to be present in waste streams. Investigators have evaluated solvent and polymer prototype recovery processes and are currently developing the design concept for the dissolution tank.\n\nPOLY-SOLVE plans to deliver recycling solutions for two types of plastics to date typically dumped in landfills. With decentralised solvent-based recycling of low-density EPS, researchers overcome the economic disadvantage of transporting these high-volume, low-content materials.\n\nSolvent-based recycling will also address PC materials filled with fibres such as those found in WEEE that are tough on mechanical recycling processes.

The most sensitive inspection methods are surface inspection methods designed for crack detection (such as MPI, eddy current and ACFM) and these do not typically attempt to measure the corrosion. However inspection of axles while the train is in service is still required and this is inconvenient and costly for the train operators. WOLAXIM aims to provide three new and better methods of crack detection and corrosion assessment for railway axle inspection. One method is for the exposed body of the axles (intended primarily for freight wagon or passenger trailing axles) and can be carried out automatically as the vehicles pass an inspection station that could be installed in carriage sidings or marshalling yards. A second method is specifically for the hollow axles of high speed trains and aims to improve the speed of the inspection and improve crack detection reliability. This could be deployed while the train is in depot overnight and without dismantling of the wheelset. The third method is to improve the measurement of corrosion and therefore the sentencing of corro", 66561.0, 1261622.0, "WOLAXIM", null, null, null, "http://www.wolaxim.eu", "http://www.twi.co.uk", null, "fp7_96662_999912764"], ["6AL", "Integrated Process Chain for Automated and Flexible Production \nof Fibre-Reinforced Plastic Products", "Twi Limited", "Lightweight components and their energy-efficient production will form one of the most important key factors for the European industry to fulfil the ever increasing global demands.

Very recently, the European rail industry has started showing signs of recovery after a long period of steady decline. The technological advances in train design during the last few decades have led to the manufacturing of faster and more comfortable trains making rail transport a more attractive option for passengers in comparison to other means of transportation. The need for the society to employ greener transportation policies is expected to further enhance the role of rail transport in the global economy. Today rail networks across Europe are getting busier with trains travelling at higher speeds, carrying more passengers and heavier axle loads than ever before. The combination of these factors has put considerable pressure on the existing infrastructure, leading to increased demands in inspection and maintenance of rail assets. The expenditure for inspection and maintenance has thus, grown steadily over the last few years without however being followed by a significant improvement of the industry\u2019s safety records. A large proportion of all equipment related accidents in the rail industry is due to failed train wheels and axles. The continuous increase in train operating speeds means that catastrophic failure of a wheel or axle may result in very serious derailments, such as the one that took place in Eschede, Germany in 1998, causing loss of life, injuries, severe disruption in the operation of the network, damage to the tracks, unnecessary costs, and loss of confidence in rail transport by the general public.

In 1996, a freight train accident occurred due to an axle failure in Rickerscote, UK; it resulted in the death of one person and injury of several others. The 1998 accident in Eschede, Germany, initiated by a single failed wheel, caused the death of more than 100 passengers and 88 severe injuries. More recently, the S-Bahn derailment at Kaulsdorf, Germany in 2009 was brought about by a wheel set failure. As rail networks become busier and train speeds increase, the number of incidents linked to failed train wheel sets is expected to grow. Yet minimising wheel set failures also helps reduce maintenance costs, representing an important consideration for both train and light rail vehicle operators.\n\nCurrent available online systems detect severe wheel set defects just before they result in a catastrophic failure. Consequently, severe surface-breaking or deep internal defects are not being properly detected until the defective wheel set is taken out of service for inspection and maintenance.\n\nIn other words, the current technology deployed cannot inspect wheel sets with maximum reliability. The Saferail project is very close to developing the necessary technology for reliable and accurate inspection of wheel sets online, as well as during their production and maintenance.

It will develop this learning via an online learning platform using an open educational resources approach. The selected languages include several perceived \u201chard to learn\u201d languages that will assist participants to gain sufficient knowledge to begin a meaningful dialogue in the selected foreign language. EasySpeak will then develop a further 500 word vocabulary that is sector specific to the life sciences industry to facilitate further business engagement and then test the transferability of this core vocabulary into four further sectors.\r\n\r\nFive partners, from four EU countries will develop the materials for the \u201chard to learn\u201d (non EU) languages, including Japanese, Korean, Arabic and Chinese as well  as for  six further (EU) languages. Two of the partners are specialist life sciences cluster groups, that bring sector knowledge of need and routes to market for the materials.  The other three partners are vocational education training specialists that provide the key understanding of the development of educational online learning resources and the specific skills in the selected languages.\r\n\r\nThe UK partners will develop the learning platform and test it with English and an EU language whilst the other partners develop their allocated core language vocabularies and sector specific vocabulary.

Also, the EC has identified advanced manufacturing as key for this \"re-manufacturing\" of Europe. This will require that VET providers and HE Institutes work together to answer the needs from industry. In order to allow this collaboration between VET and HE the first step is to ensure the transferability of people between these two educational \"paths\". The HE&VET project will focus on the need of qualified personnel in joining technologies, however, always keep in mind other manufacturing technologies to ensure an higher impact.\r\n\r\nAIMS & OBJECTIVES: The project aims at promoting the collaboration between VET and HE. This objective will be achieved through the development of a methodology and tools to allow the transferability between VET and HE. \r\n\r\nCONSORTIUM:The consortium is constituted by five partners. TWI will act as Project Coordinator, in direct contact with the National Agency from UK.

For this purpose, at the start of the project, a study will be carried out in order to understand the specific requirements in terms VET and HE transferability in different countries and in different industries, where welding plays an important role. This will allow the development of a methodology in line with the requirements of the different countries and industries.\r\n\r\nIMPACT: The project results will have an impact in the manufacturing industry.
