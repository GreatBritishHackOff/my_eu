In the DIRECT consortium we propose to identify biomarkers to identify subtypes with rapid diabetes development and progression and altered response to diabetes treatments, and develop and use these biomarkers in clinical trials.\nTwo phenotyping work packages will focus on glycaemic deterioration and therapeutic response.  For each, the DIRECT consortium brings considerable existing resource, which will be augmented by large-scale prospective cohort collection with intensive physiological and imaging phenotyping. Additional data will be added, such as existing studies on acute response to intravenous beta-cell secretagogues, and functional genomics on human islets, liver, muscle and adipose tissue, to maximise the power and utility of an innovative integrated biology approach.  To enable computational multi-level integration across phenotypes and data types, a robust and secure data repository will be developed with strict data governance.   As the ultimate aim of DIRECT is patient stratification, biomarkers arising from the discovery work will be used to design one or more prospective clinical trials.  These will validate the biomarker(s) of interest, and establish utility in clinical practice and/or trial design and drug development.

Crucial in this is the lack of appropriate outcome measures that can robustly identify patient benefit from a specific therapy. The lack of specific and sensitive endpoints to differentiate between responders and non-responders both at the level of pain and tissue structure modification (disease modifying OA drug: DMOAD) has led to trials that included hundreds of patients in each arm with at least 3-years follow-up. Even despite these enormous trials, EMA and FDA have not approved any DMOAD yet. There is a general lack of understanding OA pathogenesis, which appears rather variable and likely reflecting different phenotypes with fundamental differences in disease aetiology, tissue alterations, clinical manifestations (pain/mobility) and disease progression. Although the current mind-set for drug treatment in the field is moving to a more personalized medicine and patient stratification approach, there are no accepted methods or guidelines to classify patients according to their prognosis and differentiate between subsets in terms of diagnosis methodology and treatment plan. The APPROACH consortium brings together a competent and multidisciplinary group of stakeholders that will setup \u2013 for the first time \u2013 a longitudinal cohort based on highly innovative stratification methods that identifies different OA phenotypes and subsequently develop guidelines for differentially diagnosing the right patient for the right treatment.\n\nThe stratified medicine APPROACH \nThe APPROACH consortium brings together a unique complimentary set of skills to develop, validate and link biomarkers with biological processes and clinical end points in OA patient subsets. This will support future regulatory qualification and guide clinical trials for relevant endpoint validation, thereby paving the road for stratified or personalized medicine. This leads to the following overall objectives of the consortium:\n- Implement and establish a new, integrated and comprehensive database platform of existing data from partners that will be extended with newly collected longitudinal data, incorporating novel high quality biomarkers.\n- Define subsets of (phenotypically) different patients in both the existing cohorts as well as (later) in the new longitudinal extension cohorts and subsequently identify the \u201cright patient\u201d to treat for each subset/phenotype via innovative stratification techniques. \n- Optimize, introduce and validate the next generation imaging methodologies (modality \\ post-processing), human motion analysis and biochemical assays to enable more efficient and reliable diagnoses and treatment of OA patients. \n- Identify mechanistic targets for patient subsets, create prediction models and establish guidelines for a DMOAD development that forms the roadmap for OA.\n\nAPPROACH: a tri-partite partnership between relevant stakeholders\nThe ambitious objectives of the APPROACH consortium require the mobilization of a broad set of skills and extensive expertise, from academics, clinicians and the private sector.

Current treatment modalities are largely ineffective, necessitating the urgent discovery of new regimens.\n\nThe main cause of chronic lung disease is lung fibrosis, a phenomenon that follows persistent injury as part of the normal reparative process. Fibrosis is the aberrant attempt of our bodies to heal the damaged tissue, causing pathological conditions. It entails the deposition of excessive collagen and extra-cellular matrix in an organ or tissue and is linked to chronic inflammatory disorders.\n\nScientists on the EU-funded 'Investigating the role of the immune system in the development of fibrosis in the lung' (LUNG FIBROSIS) project worked under the rationale that to reverse fibrosis one needs to understand the mechanism. In this context, they focused their work on lung macrophages and how their manipulation could provide a novel therapeutic target to limit fibrosis.\n\nThey generated a lung fibrosis mouse model by injecting Schistosoma mansoni eggs that get trapped in the lung and cause inflammation and granulomas. Their experiments indicated that T\u00a0lymphocytes are responsible for triggering lung fibroblasts to initiate the phenomenon of fibrosis. By depleting macrophages at different stages of the inflammatory process, LUNG FIBROSIS partners showed that these immune cells contribute to granuloma formation.\n\nFurther examination of the macrophage mode of action demonstrated a role of these cells in recruiting T\u00a0cells to the lung. This led to an attenuation of the Th2 response including cytokines and related genes.\n\nCollectively, the LUNG FIBROSIS study revealed a central role of macrophages in increasing inflammation and supporting fibrosis in the lung.

Scientists are developing composite plugs for treatment of osteoarthritis, vertebral cements for compression fractures of the spine and composites for maxillofacial fracture fixation.\n\nThe first 18 months of the four year project have been devoted to laying the groundwork to support manufacture and testing of novel medical devices. This includes defining detailed specifications, developing new materials processing routes and creating novel materials. In preparation for new product development, researchers are assessing the materials for biocompatibility using human and animal primary cells. These are being tested under load-bearing and non-load bearing conditions.\n\nDevelopment of new medical devices is getting under way with important progress to date. In the coming months, the devices will be subjected to more realistic testing in preparation for clinical trials. Scientists are also planning a life cycle analysis using newly developed cost models to determine the best ways to minimise both costs and environmental impact.\n\nBuilding on the broad expertise of partners, RESTORATION is braving new frontiers of medical science with medical devices based on novel improved bioceramic materials. By the end of the project, the new devices will be ready for clinical trials for rapid and maximum benefits for the five partner SMEs. Long term sales potential of the new devices is predicted to be around 350 million EURO per year.

PhD students in training are currently addressing two limitations of industrial enzyme production: cellular heterogeneity and bottlenecks in the secretion of heterologous enzymes.\n\nATRIEM revealed that cellular heterogeneity, or the differences in the productivity of individual cells in a population, is related to stress. By constructing an array of fluorescent promoter-reporter fusions it was possible to investigate how individual cells respond to high induction of a secreted protein. With the promoters acting as stress indicators, results demonstrated the connection between the induced stress and heterogenic response.\n\nOngoing efforts include construction of a randomised promoter library to find optimal promoters, and investigating the effect of gene location on production efficiency. The project has already revealed significant differences in expression levels based on where the gene of interest is integrated into the genome.\n\nProtein secretion is addressed by fluorescent microscopic studies of Bacillus subtilis. ATRIEM found that the HALO tag is an excellent fluorescent reporter for cell biological studies. The tag can be labelled with different fluorophores and is currently being optimised for pulse-chase labelling to study protein dynamics.\n\nBecause enzyme production requires overexpressing proteins, this can overwhelm the secretion apparatus. Increasing the concentration of the secretion components might mitigate this potential bottle neck. The project aims to overproduce the different components and see whether enzyme production can be improved.\n\nIn addition to the research training, participants disseminate their results at international conferences. The outreach activities at pre-college level are preparing potential prospects for a career in industry and technology.

As an example up to 10% of the energy cost of a personal care product manufacturing plant (PCP) is used in residual management. Given this high cost, residual handling methods must be re-evaluated and made more energy efficient both to reduce costs, but also to make these processes more environmentally friendly.

Until recently, the daunting complexity of the ageing process, the conspicuous lack of tools to study it, and a dearth of experimentally tractable model systems have greatly hindered any hypothesis-driven reductionist approaches to understand the molecular basis of ageing. Whereas molecular and cellular damage is thought to be a cause of ageing and age-related pathologies, little is known about the molecular events that underlie ageing or determine longevity. A large number of progeroid syndromes that are characterized by an early onset of age-related pathology are linked to inborn defects in genome maintenance thus pointing towards damage in (nuclear) DNA as a major culprit of ageing and age-related pathology. DNA damage fuelled by intrinsic and\nenvironmental sources of genotoxic insult and by errors of genome maintenance mechanisms invariably accumulates with advancing age. The outcome of DNA damage is diverse and generally adverse: DNA lesions may physically obstruct essential processes including DNA replication and transcription. In addition, DNA damage activates checkpoint responses that lead to a reduction in cell proliferation potential (cellular senescence) or to an increase in cell death.

The increase in the percentage of elderly people serves to strain the Social Security to the point of bankruptcy. The only way to alleviate the suffering caused by age-related degenerative disease is to fully understand the underlying forces which drive ageing and design strategies to delay it. Mitochondria are considered as central modulators of longevity in different species. It has been proposed that free radicals cause the accumulation of oxidative damage and as a result ageing. In accordance with  this, production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) by complex I negatively correlates with longevity. However, the overexpression of antioxidants or the reduction of ROS levels does not increase lifespan. These contradictory data can only be reconciled if complex I is modulating longevity through a ROS independent mechanism. We have expressed the alternative internal NADH dehydrogenase 1 (NDI1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in Drosophila melanogaster. The expression of NDI1 does not change the level of ROS but increases both the ratio of NAD\\/NADH and Drosophila longevity. The main objective of this proposal is to study the mechanisms by which complex I regulates longevity. My general hypothesis is that complex I regulates longevity through a ROS independent mechanism. I propose that complex I controls the cellular levels of NAD\\/NADH, keeping their levels at an equilibrium that favours the optimal functioning of the cell. When the ratio is moved towards NADH ageing is promoted, whereas when it is moved towards NAD\\ pro-survival pathways are activated.

This has already been demonstrated in the printing industry and in areas such as printed textiles, ceramic tile decoration, sensors, and organic light-emitting diodes applications.\n\nFrom the competitiveness perspective, European companies are strong in areas like printing with metals and other functional materials.

But predominantly it enables higher energy conversion efficiency by ensuring that prime movers are effectively loaded at all times and across all operating conditions. This dominating advantage cannot be matched by mechanical transmission systems because gearboxes offer little chance of integrating a high number of prime movers in the restricted space of a ship whereas this integration is straight forward when managed electrically. Thus the electric ship concept offers reduced emissions through improved efficiency of engine operation but critically it offers significant reduced emissions during the critical phase of entry to littoral water when with speed generally reduced engines in a mechanical systems become very lightly loaded.\n\n\n\nIt is proposed to enhance the electric ship concept so it suits a wider range of vessels than currently. The principal barrier to adoption of the electric ship concept in merchant ships is the size of the equipment. However if size reductions can be achieved then adopting the electric ship concept in a wider range of merchant ships will, as described above, reduce emissions and improve the impact on global warming. Overall this impact will be significant given the current and anticipated levels of global trade and the proportion to be moved by sea transport.\n\n\n\nThis challenging ambition, to enable the adoption of the electric ship concept in a wider range of merchant ships, will demand the development of new technologies across all of marine electrical engineering:\n\n\n\n1.  High Temperature Superconductivity (HTS): This is a technology that allows smaller principal electrical components and an increase in efficiency.\n\n\n\n2.  Wireless monitoring:  This provides simpler internal control communication and enables the adoption of more advanced control regimes (as offered by the electrification of propulsion).\n\n\n\n3.  Harbour Shore Electrical Supplies: Running lightly loaded generators in harbour - as is commonly the practice among merchant ship operators - threatens the environment in a sensitive zone. The lack of any propulsion load prevents loading the generators more effectively. The answer is to supply the ship with electricity from shore connections. This does not need technological innovation but the widespread adoption of shore supplies demands standardisation among connectors and mode of electrical supply that has yet to be investigated.\n\n\n\n4.  Electrical actuation: This is a technology which aims to replace mechanically actuated auxiliaries by using direct electrical actuators and reduces size, cost, maintenance and improves efficiency\n\n\n\nThe benefits of these proposed innovations will be tested by developing designs for specific ship types: multi-purpose, cruise and container.

Lateral flow immunodiagnostics has long offered the promise of fast, high quality testing for substances of low molecular weight. There have however been very real challenges to bringing the full power of such technology to bear in this area. The problem is simply size. Large analytes can support the simultaneous binding of both capture and detector antibodies, allowing typical excess-reagent sandwich immunoassays to be formatted in which increasing analyte concentration provides an increase of observable signal over a very low zero background. Small molecules are simply not large enough to support such simultaneous binding. Alternative systems in effect measure how much analyte is not present. This causes major problems in terms of precision, sensitivity and read-out where, classically, increasing concentration of analyte reduces the signal produced, making point-of-need devices often difficult to read. What is required is a robust system in which there is no observable signal in the absence of analyte, and even low level samples give an obvious observable signal over this zero background. SALIANT offers a system based on a small bindable moiety that is first conjugated close to the binding site of a primary antibody against the analyte such that when analyte binds the antibody, the moiety can still be bound by a labelled secondary antibody.

However extraction of the hydrogen requires significant energy input; either thermal, electrical or light. By utilizing a renewable electrical energy source, water electrolysis offers a practical route to sustainable hydrogen production. The coupling of electrolysis with renewable electrical energy (e.g. from wind) enables the full available energy to be stored as fuel (hydrogen) when there is low electrical energy demand. In addition water electrolysis offers a convenient method of localised hydrogen supply which overcomes problems and issues of its distribution. The use of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) or solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) in water electrolysis enables hydrogen production from pure (demineralised) water and electricity. PEM water electrolysis systems offer advantages over traditional technologies; greater energy efficiency, higher production rates (per unit electrode area), and more compact design. A restricting aspect of water electrolysis is the relatively high cost of the electrical energy. This programme is targeted at reducing this electrical energy requirement and reducing electrolyser cost by researching new materials for electrodes and membranes in PEM electrolysers that function at higher temperatures; thereby reducing thermodynamic energy requirements and accelerating electrode kinetics. Thus the aim of this research is to form a collaborative training programme that focuses on hydrogen production from water using advanced, medium temperature proton exchange membrane electrolysers.

Their low weight, along with their inherent resistance to corrosion and fatigue, enables more fuel efficient and sustainable transport structures.

With EU funding of the project 'Modern polymer-based catalysts and microflow conditions as key elements of innovations in fine chemical syntheses' (POLYCAT), scientists are taking a holistic approach so as to make headway in this area.\n\nPOLYCAT researchers are delivering novel polymer-based nanoparticle catalysts and microflow reactors to synthesise active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The APIs have particular relevance to the pharmaceutical, crop protection and food supplement sectors. Novel catalyst systems using green solvents including water are particularly targeted to replace a number of toxic chemical or microbiological reaction steps.\n\nDuring the current reporting period, scientists developed six polymer-based catalyst supports and began tailoring them to process needs. Nanoparticulate catalysts were synthesised that could have industrially relevant applications from four of the six catalyst supports. Modelling was also used to support catalyst design. The consortium has already submitted a patent application for one of the novel catalyst systems and a second application is being prepared.\n\nWith processes developed to accommodate both conventional batch and continuous processing modes, the first catalysts are now being tested. POLYCAT has also begun the development of techniques to insert the catalysts into the polymeric supports.\n\nIn addition, micro-reactor design and optimisation is progressing well. Micro-reactors, literally miniaturised micro-fluidic devices, enable the precise control of reaction variables and use minimal quantities of reagents. Further, they are easily scalable. During this reporting period, scientists began testing and benchmarking their micro-reactor while simultaneously investigating the scale-up of concepts. In addition, they have begun design adaptations of a well developed container plant concept to suit API synthesis.\n\nPreliminary results from the cost assessment and life cycle assessment (LCA) suggest that POLYCAT concepts could reduce environmental impact anywhere from 20\u00a0% up to orders of magnitude with a decrease in production cost of around 10\u00a0%.

We discovered recently that RNA endonucleases (RNases) encoded by toxin - antitoxin (TA) genes are required for persistence of the model bacterium Escherichia coli. We have shown that the RNases inhibit translation by cleavage of mRNA or tRNA and that their activation halts cell growth and induces persistence. We propose a testable model in which persistence is induced by stochastic activation of the RNases.

Based on extensive experience from classical clinical trials of two other AONs in DMD patients, the consortium has designed a highly innovative development plan, including an innovative clinical trial design that if successful, could be applied to future clinical trials in DMD and other rare diseases. Also novel biomarkers and functional outcome measures will be incorporated in additional to more established ones.

Without these methods in place, it was estimated that any technology approaches and developments would be less effective.\n\nTEFLES developed and combined after-treatment, hydrodynamics and power-generation technologies for emission reduction in ships.

For this purpose, they are using oligonucleotides as molecular patches to produce the shorter version of the dystrophin protein.\n\nPrior work by the members of the EU-funded http://www.skip-nmd.eu/ (SKIP-NMD) consortium successfully demonstrated the therapeutic outcome of skipping exon 51 in clinical trials with boys with DMD. The scope of SKIP-NMD is to extend this work in other children with DMD and perform skipping of exon 53.\n\nAfter finalising the optimal antisense oligonucleotide sequence, researchers have performed toxicology and pharmacology studies to prepare for the clinical trial. Good manufacturing practices- antisense oligonucleotide molecules have been produced and a clinical trial protocol has been submitted for authorisation. The study will also validate novel outcome measures and assess the role of muscle magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy and serum biomarkers levels as a means of monitoring therapeutic intervention.\n\nAlthough antisense oligonucleotide therapy is not a cure, and for therapy to be effective it should be administered at regular intervals throughout life, it is expected that this novel therapeutic intervention will result in reduction of muscle damage and slow down disease progression.

A growing body of research suggests that reduced levels of out-of-home mobility can have widespread, detrimental effects for older adults. Adults for whom mobility is a problem suffer in a variety of ways.  Not only are their social lives restricted but they are also more limited in terms of their access to good nutrition, leisure and other activities.  For example people with restricted mobility have fewer choices in terms of where and when they can shop, and they have been found to experience problems in maintaining a balanced diet. Shopping has been found to be a useful way of maintaining physical exercise as well as providing the opportunity for social interaction. However, older adults can lose confidence in their ability to go out independently, particularly in unfamiliar and crowded spaces and may start to withdraw into their homes.Several factors adversely affect mobility, the most obvious being physical impairment, loss or reduction of  visual and auditory ability and of the key function of balance. Less recognised but as important is the decline of cognitive abilities, which reduces confidence in manoeuvring around unfamiliar environments.  The slower reaction to external stimuli and the diminished navigation skills can be predictors of the onset of more severe cognitive problems. With the median age in Europe projected to grow from 37.7 (2003) to 52.3 (2050), the population of potentially afflicted people is substantial.In this context, sustained levels of physical and social activity by a prolonged autonomous mobility are  key to successful ageing. In this project, we pursue autonomous mobility through the development of the so-called c-walker. This mobility aid supports navigation in crowded and unstructured spaces by acquiring sensory information, by anticipating the intent of human agents and by deciding the path that minimises the risk of accidents.  The c-walker is aimed at providing physical, cognitive and emotional support to older adults in public environments such as shopping centres and airports. Its expected benefits are a reduction in the anxiety of navigating in these environments and an increased likelihood of continued autonomous use of these environments. The c-Walker has a merely assistive role: it recommends a course to the user  through visual, acoustic and haptic interfaces.

A common misbelief discovered in the interviews was underestimation of time between exposure and illness as well as the contagiousness of foodborne illnesses.  \n\nThe survey results proved the robustness of the interview results. Survey outcomes revealed that the incubation period for foodborne illnesses and risks of person-to-person contagion deserve special attention in consumer communications. A fuller mental model may help consumers translate their safe food knowledge into practice.  \n\nFor the European phase, interviews with 12 people revealed similar results to the United States exercise. The researchers could therefore apply the results of the American study to a representative group of over 500 British consumers. The results showed incorrect beliefs about many issues including correct food handling and recall procedures by government agencies and food producers.  \n\nSimilar results in both countries should help food health communicators to address the common misconceptions held by consumers.

RNA is either directly used by the cell or decoded into proteins during translation. The accuracy of transcription is thus essential for proper functioning of the cell. In all living organisms transcription is performed by multisubunit RNA polymerases, enzymes that are highly conserved in evolution from bacteria to humans. Surprisingly, the mechanisms that ensure accuracy of transcription remain largely unknown. Recently I discovered a novel mechanism of transcriptional proofreading used by bacterial RNA polymerase. I showed that the RNA transcript itself assists RNA polymerase in identifying and correcting mistakes. This discovery led to the hypothesis that this transcript-assisted proofreading is the universal mechanism of transcriptional error correction in all three domains of life. In this proposal we will investigate this hypothesis and search for other mechanisms of transcriptional proofreading used by bacterial, archaeal, and three eukaryotic RNA polymerases. For the first time experimental systems will be built for the simultaneous investigation of transcription elongation complexes formed by bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic RNA polymerases I, II and III, which will be used to elucidate the mechanisms of error correction used by these RNA polymerases. Using molecular modelling, directed mutagenesis and in vivo screenings we will investigate the impact of these proofreading mechanisms on the total fidelity of transcription in vitro and in vivo.

Extensive research has been done to characterise and understand the neural circuits underlying such capacity. The locust has been established as a preferred model because it has a pair of large and uniquely identified visual neurons, the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) and the postsynaptic descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD) that respond selectively to the images of an object approaching towards its eye. These neurons have been associated with the triggering of last moment avoidance responses such as gliding dives during flight. So far, all studies have used adult locusts. However these animals avoid predation by birds throughout their lives and the preferred escape response varies during development. Juvenile locusts display escape behaviours on the ground, such as hiding and jumping, that require more time than emergency dives and therefore are triggered early in the loom. DCMD may have a role in guiding these early reactions as it starts responding long before collision. However there have been no attempts yet to record from the DCMD during hiding. The present research aims at characterising the visual cues that produce the hiding response in the adult and studying the possible involvement of the LGMD and DCMD neurons in such behaviour.

Furthermore, in a competition between species, the production of signalling molecules that can actively induce the biofilm dispersal pathway of the competitors has evolved. In preliminary work, we observed that mature biofilms of a marine Micrococcus luteus strain and Escherichia coli could be dispersed by metabolites from a growing biofilm culture of a marine Bacillus licheniformis isolate.

The aims are divided into six objectives: 1) develop practical resources grounded in asset based knowledge to support new ways for public service actors to re-define operational processes, 2) produce and deliver nine real-life pilots to co-create a set of relational public services with various combinations of public sector, civil society and commercial actors, 3) draw together cross-cutting lessons from pilots and utilise innovative visualisation methods to share and validate new ideas and models of good governance, 4) apply innovative approaches appropriate to local contexts and user groups to gather the necessary user insight to co-create services, 5) ensure sustainability by establishing local trainers for animating dialogue and collating user voice, embedded in community networks, 6) mobilise new knowledge from piloting and validating by creating an accessible, user friendly roadmap to co-creation for service providers and their partners.\n\nThe project will be implemented as a joint venture with 24 partners from 10 EU countries.", 173603.0, 4329190.0, "CoSIE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ncl.ac.uk/", null, "h2020_212384_999985417"], ["7RU", "Liver Investigation: Testing Marker Utility in Steatohepatitis", "University of Newcastle Upon Tyne", "Strongly associated with the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes that are testing healthcare systems worldwide, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common cause of advanced liver disease that is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression.

Also, animal models to study the neuronal mechanisms of related processes have only recently become known.

The ATL brings together identity-specific content from the senses but the neuronal mechanisms for this convergence are entirely unknown. My core hypothesis is that auditory voice- or visual face-identity input into key ATL convergence sites elicits a sensory-modality invariant representation, which once elicited is robust to degradation or inactivation of neuronal input from the other sense. The central aim is to test this in human patients being monitored for surgery and to directly compare and link the results with those in monkeys where the neuronal circuit and mechanisms can be revealed using optogenetic control of neuronal responses.

However, finding out about the world outside is energetically expensive: it involves complex sensory systems to collect the information, and dedicated neural systems to process it. Therefore, the benefits of acquiring information need to be balanced against the costs of receiving and processing it. Consequently, evolution has equipped animals with sensory systems that fit their lifestyle and environment, to give them the information they need to enhance their survival and reproduction. However, most, if not all, animals have multiple sensory systems: how should investment in different sensory systems be balanced, and what factors affect the trade-off between investment in different sensory modalities? When environmental constraints limit the usefulness of specific sensory modalities (e.g. living in the dark), shifts in investment in different sensory modalities can occur.  What is not known is how trade-offs occur between sensory modalities that are still useful to an animal, but perhaps their relative importance changes according to lifestyle or environmental factors.

However, we chose to give this opportunity only to 12 participants which gives us the possibility to have six extra safe work placements in case of problems. \r\nAfter several months of training (see appendix 1: work plan), the students will go to England in January & February 2015.  \r\nThey will do a work placement linked to their vocational training during four weeks in the area of Whitley Bay and Newcastle. \r\nStudents in administration & management will be welcomed in companies such as OXFAM, North Tyneside Council or Tynemet College or international companies such as  Fuda or Ferguson Transports. \r\nSales and trade students will get the opportunity to improve their skills in charity shops such as Age UK, Barnardos, British Heart Foundation, Red Cross,  and shops such as FE Maughan and Marks and Spencer, the new partner in this Erasmus+ project. \r\nOur students will individually stay at selected host families in order to encourage relationships and improve their English.   \r\nMrs Christine Goodwin, the manager of Northumbria school of English, will be in charge of selecting host families, providing linguistic support, and organising one cultural activity each weekend. She has been involved in our mobility projects for four years. \r\nOn Tuesday afternoons the participants will meet Whitley Bay High School students during tuitions where they will attend linguistic and cultural supports. Whitley Bay High School teachers all agree that French students show a real interest in the English language and culture.  This could lead them to be more open-minded and dynamic. Our participants mobility could also offer future prospects to English students who are not willing to leave their country. It will enable us to organise exchanges and encourage mobility in both countries. Our vocational high school is located in Thionville, in the core of \"La Grande R\u00e9gion\" (Luxemburg, France and Germany). This location makes this experience relevant. Indeed, mobility with these three countries is a characteristic of local employment markets with the increasing number of border workers. This new application aims at securing this need to get interested in other farther European countries. One of our school project priorities is the mobility development. Moreover getting involved in such a project enables to meet the demand of the objectives of our European sections.  \r\nSuch a project offers obvious and important benefits for our students. This mobility is a profitable experience, useful and enriching their professional career. Discovering a new culture and improving language skills will develop autonomy, responsability,  and self-fulfillment.  Besides, a one-month work placement for our students, in an English company, will encourage the awareness of  European citizenship. Indeed very few students are unaware of this concept because they are not used to travelling. The impact of mobility on our students will help them to pass their examination more easily and to get the \"European\" Mention plus the \"Europass Mobility Certificate\". Thus, thanks to an improved C.V., their job search or future studies should be faced with less anxiety.  \r\nConsequently, they will be more likely to work on the European or international market.  This Erasmus+ project will make our Sophie Germain high school, the Region Lorraine and the European Union more attractive and enhance their values and fame. \r\nWe will try and share our experience and activities with the press and media, which hopefully should raise interest in other students to join the programme. \r\nTo put it in a nutshell, the educational systems have to upgrade and fit into the new ways of teaching and learning.

We are specialized in the training of people who are going to work in laboratories (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Pharmacy, Micro Technology).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince more than 20 years the school is conducting EU projects (Leonardo da Vinci Mobilities, Pilot Projects and Innovation Transfer Projects as well as Comenius-Grundtvig training courses) and has thereby established a large network of partners, i.e. laboratories in universities, research institutes and companies in EU regions from Troms\u00f6 to Sevilla, from Galway to Budapest and from French Guyane to New Caledonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor academics trainings in foreign countries are a common thing to do whereas for technical staff going abroad is still unusual and due to the different educational systems generally difficult to arrange. The network of Lise Meitner School allows lab technicians to participate in individual educational trainings in a wide range of subject areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities / Procedure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEUMobil will allow up to 50 young graduates in natural-scientific and technical professions to take part in individual mobilites. The participants will stay for 14 weeks in a research lab or in a company. Usually they are part of an ongoing research project in international research groups. Thereby the participants can extend their professional qualification as well as their language skills and intercultural competences. They learn to cope with an unfamiliar environment and become more self-reliant. This results in a great leap forward in their personality development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe receiving partners are research institutes, companies and laboratories in the natural-scientific departments of universities. They work in a global context and in international teams which make is easy for our participants to fit in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants can apply for a grant via our school website. After individual mentoring in the EU office of the school they are placed according to their qualification and their career plans. The actual period of the stay is being negotiated individually. Travel plans and arrangements with the receiving partner and the mentor are being done by the participants. Still the EU office provides advice face-to-face, via email or telephone. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe learning agreement and quality commitment between the participant, the sending and the receiving organisation describes the individual tasks of the participant and the supporting measures during the training placement. During their stay the participants report on a regular basis to the EU office of Lise-Meitner-Schule. On request most sending organisations provide the participants with a job reference. The europass Mobility however is an integral part of the project and will be handed out after all paper work is completed (including the participants report). The participants usually come the the EU office for a personal evaluation interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe receiving organisations are being visited every few years to guarantee the quality of the placements and intensify the contacts to the local mentors and researchers. During the project two such visits are  budgeted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Aims / Results\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants\u2026\r\n\r\n- acquire and consolidate professional and methodical competences\r\n\r\n- gain and extend intercultural competences and language skills\r\n\r\n- strengthen their self-confidence and abilities to work in a team \r\n\r\n- increase their chances on the labour market\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lise-Meitner-Schule\u2026\r\n\r\n- consolidates and expands its European network of research groups and laboratories\r\n\r\n- intensifies its insight into international research and methodology in order to adjust the local curricula according to present needs within the respective occupational area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe receiving organisations\u2026\r\n\r\n- get the chance to engage well qualified staff which can contribute on a comparably high level to research projects\r\n\r\n- intensify their insight into vocational education in Germany\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLongterm Benefits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides of the individual support of young graduates from German vocational schools the project fosters the cooperation between educational institutions of related professional areas between the participating partner countries.

It wishes it could offer them the opportunity to get opened up  to other cultures and to enrich their professional practices.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn 2014, 11 schools will be involved in our project: Bonne sur Menoge, La Balme de Sillingy, La Grive, P\u00e9ronnas, Vulbens.

La Balme de Sillingy is involved on both programs\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground and needs: Apprentices are young girls and boys aged from 15 to 20. They often come from rural areas, they attend a vocational training (vocational A levels), sometimes in a European section. Because they are young and rooted to their place of living, they are not used to going far from it especially in an international context and without their parents. That\u2019s why we included in our training plans this mobility that would enable participants to increase their autonomy, to accept others, to develop intercultural skills, and self-confidence.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStudents involved in this program prepare a Vocational high school diploma. Four vocational fields are concerned: trade, customer service, administrative management and horticulture. From a professional point of view, the European training aims at enriching the CV in order to make it easier for the apprentices to find a job after their studies. Indeed during three weeks they will be included in a foreign company, they will discover new working methods and equipment, techniques and tools. They will be able to compare them to the one they usually use in France, in a reflexive approach. We expect that, in a total immersion context, they could become more flexible, and also develop their linguistic skills\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA working plan in the host country has been defined by each school. According to the education reference document, the project managers negotiate the training contents together with the internships\u2019 supervisors before the stay. In our project, students will first observe the activities in their work placement then they will gradually participate to the usual tasks concerning administrative management, parks and gardens maintenance or trading.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdult beneficiaries are teachers (technical or general subjects), school leaders, education staff, and internship supervisors. They plan to go to United Kingdom and Finland to discover another education system, new monitoring and pedagogical knowledge. They also wish to study work practices in professional fields such as health and social care, administrative management in the UK and car maintenance in Finland. The European mobility could also be an opportunity to strengthen the place of internship supervisors concerning design of training modules and to reinforce partnerships.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of its involvement in the European programs for the mobility of the youngster, the \u00ab Maisons Familiales Rurales\u201d training center of Rh\u00f4ne-Alps sets up a procedure to follow the progress and to assess its group projects.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUsually we expect the mobility projects to have positive impacts on all actors involved in our education program. Concerning students, we hope that thanks to this first experience of mobility, they wish to become opened up to others countries and get new opportunities to work or travel abroad. As far as the staff is concerned, professionals wish to improve their teaching and mentoring methods or develop youth integration in our vocational education. For schools the involvement in Europeans program is a way to make the MFR and its block-release trainings more attractive.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFinally our previous experiences showed us that when they came back to their employers (employer?), apprentices were more self-confident, more autonomous so more efficient than before experiencing mobility.

Through the project, the expectation is to sensitize and to train 36 participants from 10 different countries (youth workers/operators and people who work in the youth field),  of which 18 coming from the Occidental side of Europe and 18 coming from the Oriental Europe. The 18 participants coming from the Occidental side of Europe will be 6 from Italy (which is the Country where the activities will happen), 3 from France, 3 from the United Kingdom, 3 from Portugal and 3 from Austria, while the 18 participants coming from the Oriental Europe will be 6 from Moldavia, 3 from Georgia, 3 from Armenia, 3 from Belarus and 3 from Ukraine. There will be a specific attention to participants with fewer opportunities (cultural, social, economic obstacles) in order to foster social inclusion.  \r\n\r\nResults of the project: a photo gallery and 6 short films dealing with a specific human right which will be chosen by each team the group will be divided in. The results will be exposed during the Refugee Day in 2015, on June 20th, promoted by Cooperativa Rinascita with the collaboration of the Municipality of Copertino and other no-profit organisations of the territory. The initiative will also be carried out by the other Partner Organisations of the project, in their own Countries.\r\n\r\nExpected impact: the training will increase the awareness of the 36 participants on human rights, on sending and receiving organizations (their workers, their contexts, their beneficiaries), on the Municipality of Copertino and its citizens. The impact is also foreseen on the territories of the sending organizations, through the dissemination of the results of the project.

It fosters the understanding that entrepreneurship and self-employment offer pathways for young people to emerge from unemployment and social exclusion. It pays special attention to a socially aware, sustainable entrepreneurship model, which is closely linked to people and to local communities, and primarily aimed at contributing to the general good of society, rather than a model of entrepreneurship solely as a business venture.

In these economic hard times,  foreign companies find it more and more difficult to give students an allowance for their internship. This is the reason not every student can go abroad. To enable an internship abroad for all students, this application is done. \r\nThis application consists of a total of 6 partial projects, in which the focus lies on the work experience the students achieve in this internship and for teachers to gain more English language proficiency. This is mainly for the teaching methods. \r\n\r\nThe projects offer the 92 students (VET, Commerce, Trade, Hospitality, Marketing & Events, Tourism and recreation) an orientation on the international labourmarket and intensive training oriented language learning. The student acquires a better vision of his future labour, knows where his occupation stands on the international labour market and enhances his English/Spanish language skills.\r\nThe practical work experience offers  the possibility of gaining an impression at various compagnies. The students become prepared for their definitive entrance in the business comminity, because they run fewer risks of shortly drowning in the multitude of new information and impressions. The fear of 'the jump at the deep end' that the students inevitably need to make will be removed. \r\nThe practical work experience, in a foreign county, will give the training a completely new dimension.

Once the programme launched, the Regional Training Centre is the link between the agency and the different branches. To ensure the success of the project, three official representatives have been appointed to guide the branches in the preparation and follow-up of their actions.\r\n\r\nThe branches that chose to join realise that it is difficult to envisage a professional future for the youth and the adults without thinking of mobility, and social integration or an opening to the world. Consequently, our proposition aims to improve the CVs of apprentices, and to ensure a better employability, in France and abroad. The realisation of this general objective will become possible with the development of key competences such as communication (in a foreign language), adaptability, taking  initiatives\u2026For the teaching and training professionals, the aim will be to find out about other teaching methods, a different economy and cultural environment, and to experience, like our apprentices, European mobility.\r\n\r\nIn this programme, 120 apprentices and 43 professionals are applying for mobility. The youths are studying on courses such as professional landscape gardening, horticulture, management and administration, sales and retail, reception and security\u2026The majority are male between 16 and 23, and who live in rural or suburban areas. Most have travelled, but only with school trips or their family. The students are on a course level IV (BTEC National or BTEC First), and in apprenticeships. \r\nThe 43 professionals are either teacher-trainers in general or vocational  subjects, and  as the objective of the project is to learn about teaching and learning practices, in both cultural and professional areas in foreign countries, or, employers and apprentice mentors who  are involved in actively animating the branches involved.\r\n\r\nThe participants will be prepared in order to overcome any apprehension they may have and to benefit fully from the experience. Therefore, the branches have planned activities to suit the groups: questionnaires to prepare for their work placement reports, research on the country to ensure a better cultural understanding and additional language courses. The objective of the language lessons is to start the process of the students immersing themselves in their chosen destination by organising activities on everyday- life themes, to learn more vocabulary so that the groups will be independent.  Abroad, the groups will be able to enjoy the National Heritage of the country during the weekends. On the work placement, the apprentices will gain experience for their practical training by studying the working environment of their company, by learning the procedures, methods, and resources used. On their return, the results of the mobility will be evaluated by each branch. They have planned to put into place assessment tools, surveys/questionnaires and work experience reports.\r\nThe consortium will organise oral feedback and an assessment project for each branch. The mobility will be shared amongst the different branches and their areas.\r\n\r\nWe believe the impact of the mobility will help in the success of the students for their exams, with a better motivation for their training, and better results in languages. We have seen this in recent years. In the long term, this will help successful professional integration, and for a better social integration. \r\nHowever, we are aware that these impacts can be difficult to assess as it is not easy to say what it takes to achieve one\u2019s life goals.\r\nAs far as professionals are concerned, we would like for the teaching teams to use other European practical experiences in order to innovate in the classroom. \r\nIt is also known that the branches benefit from a very positive image and better student enrolments should they give the opportunity of this work experience abroad to their apprentices. \r\nAbove all, by opening our courses to a European dimension, we will enable our apprentices to adapt to the changes found in the world of work.

When at the end of a process nearly after  30 years in 1930, that organic farming began spreaded in Europe. Organic farming activities went on in this way until the 1970s and, in 1972 with the establishment of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) they have gained an international identity. The first large-sized regulation on organic farming in the world was published in 1991 by EU and after being made many changes animal products section was added in 1999. Organic farming standards Bioswiss prepared by Switzerland Codex Alimentarius by FAO in 1999, NOP by US and JAS by Japan in 2000 have affected the global market movements all over the World. Organic farming started in small steps in 1970s began to gain commercial importance in 1990s. In 1992 the Association of Ecological Agriculture Organization (ETO) has been established. The 'Regulation on the plant and animal agricultural products produced with Ecological Methods' was enacted in 1994 and, the 'Regulation on the Principles and Practice of Organic Agriculture' was in 2002. The Organic Agriculture Law was adopted in 2004, and so to determine the rules of organic production and control mechanism was generated. Nowadays, Organic agriculture, began in 1900 in Europe and in the 1970s in our country, has gained a universal interoperability in countries located in Europe and the Americas and many other developed countries. However, the integration is not enough at the international level in our country. In our project we believe will accelerate our country in the international dimension, history, public policy, legislation and regulations, inspection and certification, growing organic forage crops, processing of animal products, storage and marketing, animal health and welfare, the problems encountered (animal health, animal welfare, animal feed), and issues such as solutions are aimed to be learned in the size of the organic livestock production in the EU.

It is planned that theoretical training will be received at the first week, cultural activities will be made at the break and the second week will be for practical training. In this context, the draft training program has been prepared and has been agreed with the host organization. Our main goal in this Project is return to our country using the time in the most proper way and, to get maximum level of theoretical and practical knowledge on organic farming. In our country there is no structure like the National Organic Farming Institute or the Organic Agriculture Research and Training Center at the present time. This is a serious shortcoming and, if it is established, technical personnel to operate are also quite inadequate. Because of this, it would be appropriate to take this training. One of the issues is to raise agenda on organic farming.

The central part of the project is supporting the organisation and monitoring of biannual conferences, Europe wide campaigns, and information dissemination. \r\nThe volunteers will support the annual UNITED campaigns against racism and antisemitism through stimulating and empowering NGO\u2019s all over Europe, creating and distributing campaign- and info-material and by producing an action agenda for active youth groups and organisations in the working field of UNITED. Furthermore they are involved in the preparation and implementation of two international UNITED conferences, with participants from different European countries and with diverse cultural backgrounds. The well-established information- and networking-tools of the pan-European UNITED network enable the volunteers to work in a professional environment. \r\nFor these volunteers we aim to:\r\n- Train them in competences to work with a large diversity of organisations and activists throughout Europe, working on different topics, coming from different cultural backgrounds, speaking many different languages. \r\n- Train them on youth activism and how to organize youth events and campaigns on local, national and international level.\r\n- Empower them to become active citizens and combat racism, discrimination through youth work activities also after they have worked with UNITED.\r\n- Develop their language skills and improve their knowledge of Dutch culture within the larger European setting.\r\n- Extend their social networks and increase the possibility for them to move on to paid jobs in the future.\r\nThrough local examples in the Netherlands the volunteers experience new methods and ways of community building.\r\n\r\nThe project is a platform where volunteers will learn about and promote cultural diversity through UNITED events such as European campaigns and Conferences. The project promotes European Citizenship by working together within an intercultural/international team.  At the end of the project, the volunteer will be able to identify common European values and what it means to be an active European citizen. During the project, they will share with many other European NGOs and activists in the ideas of respect for Fundamental Rights and equal opportunities for different communities.  \r\n\r\nThe experience of working abroad in an intercultural environment, learning how to organize smaller events and being able to live independently will be valuable life-skills that they can use in finding employment upon their return.", "http://www.opportunityuk.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NL02-KA105-000910_2"], ["6HQ", "\u201cPutting Passion Into Action\u201dGames to activism youth in rural areas", "OPPORTUNITY GLOBAL", 11325.0, "The main theme of the \u201cPutting Passion Into Action\u201d is how to engage (disadvantaged) young people from a wide range of social and cultural backgrounds by using games as a tool for personal and social development. In addition, the training will address the role of the youth worker/leader in making contact with a wide range of (disadvantaged) young people. All of the participants are professionals or motivated volunteers that are daily involved with (disadvantaged) young people and consider innovative approaches based on creativity as a possible way of working with their target groups.  Our experience from previous trainings is that these professionals are always looking for new techniques that they can use effectively with their target groups; and that there is not a good level of knowledge, skill and experience of game playing amongst youth workers/leaders. A growing generation of disadvantaged young people currently have no work and is not involved in study. Often, their problem is a combination of cross-related problems in several areas: health, housing, work, health, education and justice. By organising this training we hope that youth workers/leaders gain more knowledge of how to activate this group of young people and to establish a deeper relationship with them what could lead to discuss/solve cross-releated problems. \u201cPutting Passion Into Action\u201d will be a 5 day training course in Kosovo that gather 22 youth workers and youth leaders together from Latvia, UK, Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Macedonia, Spain, Albania, Lithuania, Belgium, Estonia and The Netherlands. It covers topics from theory and practice of game playing, workshop planning, adapting games to suit (disadvantaged) young peoples, and the use of traditional and folk games as a tool for non-formal learning. The working method that takes a central place during the training is peer education. We strongly believe that learning from each other, sharing good and bad moments together will have effect in a positive atmosphere, promoting balance and solidarity among the participants creating the common ground in which the trainers can work on. Peer education means also: peer support, peer counseling, peer teaching, peer learning, among others. All these different kind of peer moments will happen during the training and it will give the participants the opportunity to share their knowledge, experiences and their points of views. The impact of the training will therefore be not only on participants, who will have the opportunity to develop themselves, but also on the target groups of the organizations that they represent. The methods employed over the 5 days of the training will be visual presentations, group work, group discussions and brainstorming, presentation of the Erasmus+ programme, organizing a study visit and meeting with local officials, workshops and round tables and panels discussions. While the whole programme of the training course has been designed in cooperation with the partner organisations such that in combination the activities work together to ensure that this impact is achieved.Because the programme will give participants\u2019 skills for use in their own organisations with their own target groups, the project will have a longer term more sustainable impact, multiplied to include groups of young people in organisations across Europe.  Participants \u2018organisations will start to offer projects at a higher level, with a greater understanding of the non-formal learning process, and as a result their target groups will learn more and generally benefit more from their own participation in activities.  This will have an even greater longer-term effect \u2013 by offering better activities more young people will be attracted to the work and even more will benefit from the outcomes of this project.During the later part of the training we will focus on the subject of establishing partnerships and how to develop long term strategies for successful initiatives which support effective volunteering opportunities at a European level for young people from all backgrounds (including those with fewer opportunities).  We will emphasize the fact that sharing each others vision, aims and objectives can lead to effective partnership, and look for participants to make compromises within their own practice that will allow for the development of successful projects within the context of the Erasmus+ programme.

Two types of actions are concerned and destined to apprentices and vocational training professionals. Since 2012, the CFA des MFR Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes promotes, coordinates and runs European Mobility Programmes. This fifteenth candidacy is set down according to the instigator\u2019s deliberate choice to develop learners and vocational professionals\u2019 mobility in order to open their mind to interculturalism, to Europe and to enrich their professional practice. The 7 MFR are the MFR of La Balme de Sillingy, Vulbens, Bonne sur Menoge, Sallanches Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, in Haute-Savoie; La Grive in Is\u00e8re; P\u00e9ronnas in Ain and St Chamond in Loire. They envisage the mobility of 168 apprentices. Among these MFR, three of them think of sending 2 groups at a different time.The MFR of La Balme, Vulbens and Sallanches are planning a trip for the vocational training professionals and the in-company tutors for a total of 36 beneficiaries.Beyond enriching the apprentices\u2019 CVs to be more employable, the aim of this candidacy is to open up the apprentices to the world through the development of key skills such as foreign language communication, adaptability, discovering another culture.For the professionals, the objective is to know the education system of another country, to discover other educational practice, a culture and a socio-economical environment, which is different. Like the apprentices, they are going to live as a foreigner in an unknown country.The apprentices are young people from 15 to 20 years old, often from rural origins. They are doing a vocational training at a BTEC National level in fields like landscape design, horticulture, management and administration, sales, and sales specialized in pet stores. Some of them are part of a European section. However, according to their age, most of them have never experienced mobility. Furthermore, vocational field, especially with the apprentice status, is not the best natural path when it\u2019s a question of mobility. Apprenticeship is not appreciated according to the general public point of view and young people are conscious of it. Worse, some in-company tutors are vehemently opposed against their apprentice\u2019 departure. That is the reason why we are proposing mobility in our vocational training schools so the beneficiaries can increase their interculturalism skills, their self-confidence and self-esteem and their independence. Thanks to their immersion during their 3 weeks internship, they are going to integrate a professional team, which will make them discover and practise other technics, other tools, and other organisational methods. So they will be able to compare with their own practices and analyse them. In this immersion context, they will also probably develop their ability to adapt themselves and, their language skills.Vocational training professionals are trainers in professional or general education, headmasters, and members of the educational staff, and in-company tutors. They work in fields such as sales, management/administration. They will stay a week in Spain or in Slovenia in order to know the educational system of the country, the organisation of vocational training in their field. The numerous planned visits and meetings with their counterpart will allow them to have a productive exchange on the educational subject and on tutorial know-how. This stay will allow them to establish or strengthen their relation towards sustainability. Methodologically speaking, the project activities are managed and allocated between the instigator and the MFR implied. The CFA ensures the promotion, the administrative and financial management, the follow-up and technical support, the control of the project quality and its dissemination. The steering committee, composed of 3 special advisers nominated by the instigator, the CFA des MFR director, the headmasters of each MFR, and, the technical committee, composed of the 3 special advisers and each project referent, plan and supervise all the different phases of the project. In that prospective, numerous meetings are regularly planned.We wish to have an impact on the apprentices and to give them the envy to open themselves to other experiences of that type. We also wish that they would be offered new prospects in terms of mobility. The professionals wish to develop their educational practice, to integrate the question of interculturalism and the feeling of belonging to Europe to their apprentices a bit more.These impacts should be registered in the long run in order to contribute to the development of Europe.", "http://www.northumbria.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-022742_6"], ["6SU", "Mobilit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne pour les LYc\u00e9es PROfessionnels LORrains 5", "OXFAM", 193082.0, "This ERASMUS + mobility consortium for VET students in Lorraine, also known as MELYPROLOR 5 (in French, consortium de Mobilit\u00e9 pour les LYc\u00e9ens en formation PROfessionnelle en LORraine), is in line with group projects of the previous programme LEONARDO or ERASMUS+ KA1.

A steering group (with members of the DAREIC and the GIP as well as 2 representatives of 2 schools that are members of the 5th consortium and the former group projects) will deal with devising, following and managing the projet. The person in charge of projects as well as the administratitve assistant in the DAREIC (whose mission is to favour the European and international mobility of students in the acad\u00e9mie) will be the permanent link between the mobility management committees in every school of the consortium. The project meets the goals and priorities of ERASMUS + in the field of vocational education and training \u2013 that is to say enabling the greatest number of students to take part in a quality European mobility and enhancing the cooperation between vocational schools and companies via the mobilities of staff members.MELYPROLOR 5 brings together 23 vocational, comprehensive and trades schools of the acad\u00e9mie. 19 of them already took part in one of the previous projects, which highlights the interest that these schools have found in this opportunity to join a group European project. It will permit traineeship abroad mobilities for 381 students of Premi\u00e8re or Terminale (Year 12 or 13) over a period of 14, 28, 35 or 58 days, including 8 students with fewer opportunities and 1 partially-deaf student who will be integrated to a group of 4 other students. It will also involve 135 accompagnying members of staff including 16 to go with the 8 students mentioned above, as well as 36 teachers in staff training over a period of 5 or 7 days. The different mobilities will concern 11 European countries, over a period of 2 years. The mobility management committees of 2 schools with experience in VET traineeship abroad will be more precisely in charge of the students with fewer opportunities and will be able to assess new tools and adapted methods at the end of the project and share their knowledge with all the MELYPROLOR 5 partners. This tool sharing is already carried out via the collaborative platform open to all the members of the consortium. It has improved over the different group projects and from this year, it offers new tools such as a form with the names of companies ready to answer the requests of new schools (either in the same domain or in additional domains) or a European citizenship questionnaire taken before and after the mobility. The mobilities are envisaged in 31 domains, from the restaurant industry to the art embroidery including the stone trades or the maintenance of industrial equipments.Whatever their course, the students of the technology and vocational schools often form a weakened public, not very prone to move, which is particularly the case in Lorraine (as the figures show). Thanks to the European mobility, they will develop their professional skills in a different setting as well as their language skills. They will also acquire autonomy, self-confidence, capacity for adaptation to constraints and new working methods \u2013 some qualities that will make their insertion in the working world easier, be it in France, in one of the 3 border countries or elsewhere. Beyond the accompanying staff,  often indispensable at the beginning and/or at the end of the mobility (since the students are still minors), the opportunity to include training mobilities for the school staff in this project gives these people the possibility to integrate in the receiving companies, to develop a partnership over time, to assess everyone\u2019s expectations, to negociate the training contents at best, and for some of them to register for the certification in the teaching of a subject in a foreign language (CLIL lessons).The students who will benefit from the mobilities as part of the MELYPROLOR project will have demonstrated their motivation before the departure and will build their project before, during and after the mobility with the members of the management committee along with the families and the consortium steering group. The first expected concrete result will be the validation of the EuroMobiPro certificate which, along with the EUROPASS certificate, will be added to the students\u2019 diploma.

At present it is near impossible to get fast and efficient results in adaptation and integration of such big amount of people with totally different cultural and religious background using standard means. The solution can be found in joint work of youth organisations both in countries where refugees come from and where are they heading to with the help of people living in both Eastern and Western cultures and traditions. The best and the most efficient method to solve this issue we see in non-formal peer to peer education. The objectives of the project are: 1. To use youth organisations and principles of volunteering for socialization and integration of refugees/asylum seekers. 2. To equip representatives of youth NGOs with tools and methods of non-formal education that can help them in work with refugees/asylum seekers. 3. To familiarize the representatives of NGOs with cultural specifics of the countries where refugees are coming from.  4. To promote non-discrimination and gender equality as the most important EU values. These objectives link to 2016 priorities: reaching out to marginalised young people, promoting diversity, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue, common values of freedom, tolerance and respect of human rights; equipping youth workers with competences and methods needed for transferring the common fundamental values of our society particularly to the hard to reach young people and preventing violent radicalisation of young people as well.This project will consist of two activities: a Study Visit (Jordan) and a Training Course (the Netherlands).

The working methods to address their needs will be: discussions, work in small and big groups, interactive role-playing games, icebreakers, team-building, simulations, intercultural and other parties, energizers, intercultural communication etc., plus special activities like Living Library and Forum Theatre. The participants will be given a chance to act as trainers/facilitators. Informal communications and meetings with local NGOs, teachers and volunteers working with refugees, visits to the biggest refugee camp Za'atar and to Bedouins are also on the agenda of the Study Visit. The training Course will be mostly aimed at developing methods for the efficient work with refugees on local levels based on the knowledge acquired during the Study Visit. The participants of the Study visit will create a number of social ads dedicated to the engagement of young refugees to the volunteer movement. The time between the SV and the TC will be used by the participating organisations to carry out round-table discussions in their countries with the participating of local volunteer organisations. The Round-table discussions will take place in Estonia, Germany, Greece, Jordan, Morocco, Netherlands, Sweden, Turkey, UK in between. The participants of these activities will be asked to give a feedback that will be used during the TC to create new social ads of better quality that could be later used on local levels by local organisations to promote the engagement of young refugees to the voluntary work in local NGOs. During the TC the participants will evaluate the round-table discussions in their countries and create new social ads. This project will help Dutch NGOs to better understand the specifics of work with refugees, to use the technique created in this project - to use volunteer movement for the socialization and integration of refugees. They will get familiarized with the experience of the organisations from other EU countries and, what is crucial, with experience and knowledge of organisations from Islamic countries.

In addition, the training course has the following objectives:- Improve the quality of life of people with disabilities, providing tools to improve their physical, social, emotional and cognitive skills and to overcome social exclusion and the risk of marginalization and isolation;- To share experiences, information, methodologies and best practices at European level through closer cooperation between organizations and institutions working in this field.To achieve these objectives, the project strategy identifies a specific context of intervention: supporting disability through animal assisted interventions.The animal in fact has the crucial role of \"social facilitator\" between the person and the world around, with significant psychological and physical benefits and for this reason is placed in therapy programs aimed at people with mental or physical disabilities, health problems or social distress.The interaction between man and animal can be used to complement and assist the traditional therapies, representing a valuable resource for both the user benefiting from it, both for professionals who use it.The interaction between man and animal can be used to complement and assist the traditional therapies, representing a valuable resource for both the beneficiary and for the professionals who use it.The relationship with the animal facilitates communication and emotional expression when other types of relationships are ineffective. The social workers that manage these interventions are defined pet partners or pet therapists and they use methods of facilitation, mediation, socialization, non-formal education, rehabilitation etc in support of persons with disabilities, through the support of the animal.The course aims to provide the necessary skills to apply this method in many contexts of intervention (social welfare, education, health etc) and to learn, experience, export and spread a methodology that can improve the quality of youth work in supporting disabilities, disseminating the results and benefits at European level.During the training course will be carried out activities that include participatory workshops, simulations, workshops, case studies, practical demonstrations, work experience and focused round table.We will use tools and methods of non-formal learning: role playing games, focus groups, participatory planning, ice breaking activities, brainstorming, participatory storytelling, crossed interviews, speak corner, testimonials, group dynamics and socialization, observational learning, project work, visualization and reporting tools, use of virtual platforms and social network for sharing contents and dissemination of results.The course will involve 33 participants from 10 different European countries, belonging to the following categories: youth workers, social workers, educators, persons with disabilities, volunteers and family members of the disabled.After completing the course, participants will be able to design, plan and manage an animal assisted intervention, they will acquire skills on the training of an assistance dog in support of disability and they will share methodologies and good practice at European level on this field.The participating organizations will have a multiplier effect and will integrate the results of the project in all their activities to inform families, schools, institutions and other organizations about the progress, results, methodologies, skills and knowledge gained.", "http://www.opportunityuk.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT03-KA105-008322_6"], ["6HQ", "Mobility Opportunities for a better Vision of Europe", "OPPORTUNITY GLOBAL", 20509.0, "The project \"Mobility for a better Vision of Europe\" (MOVE) coordinated by the Groupe d'Appui et de Solidarit\u00e9, sending organisation, includes 3 different mobilities, 2 with the Portuguese partner Aventura Mar\u00e3o Clube and the third one with OpportUNITY, the English partner.

Our project will take place in Estonia on 15th til 24th July 2017. \r\n\r\nGoal: to organise international youth exchange to raise awareness of healthy lifestyle amongst youth in age 18-30 at the end of the project through personal experience of healthy nutrition and physical activity and through that they can implement independently healthy behavior in daily life and become more healthier. We will do at the beginning, during the project and after the project and after one month followup anonymous survey to measure if the health behaviour has changed.\r\n\r\nObjectives: to improve common understanding, find approaches, raise awareness and give support for youth about healthy lifestyle, finding new everyday habits and eventually create possibilities to be good example for others and enhance the capacity of youths and their organizations to spread the new knowledge and the skillset to the larger group of local youths in their home countries. The project will contribute to the realization that healthy lifestyle, nutrition and physical activity are directly connected to better standard of life, overcoming social isolation and discrimination (bullying), integrating common values such as tolerance and respect in a multicultural society. \r\n\r\nProfile of participants: 42 participants. We include people who have direct interests with healthy lifestyle, have or have had health problems and want to improve the quality of their life. It is important for us that the healthy lifestyle topic should be somehow important for them or they can influence more people after our youth exchange ends. The main target group of the project are young people in age 18-30.

Participants will have continuous learning process during the whole project by active involvement. They will gain more knowledge, new skills and changes in their previous attitude(s) and behaviour(s) towards healthy lifestyle which will be analyzed by self-reflection surveys of before, during, after and one month after the project. Project outcomes will be shared with partner organisations, local youth centre during the youth exchange and via social media.\r\n\r\nPotential benefits: We expect the project to influence the personal and social development of the participants and provide them with the skills required to spread the gained knowledge in their own countries and organizations. Skills and knowledge which participants learn will be involved inside the organisation and the activities they are doing in the future events.  Youth exchange pictures, videos, posters will be posted in social channels to spread the influence of the project to more youth communities.

This sector, especially in Europe due to the effect of the EU directives on water and the needs to optimize the water efficiency, is undergoing a tremendous evolution of its business processes, which have been deeply transformed due to the introduction of ICT solutions. Leak detection, water quality monitoring, real time and warning systems, climate change impact on resources, food-water-energy nexus are some of the topics that have to be addressed urgently in order to ensure a sustainable management of water resources. The concept of Smart Water Management associating deeply the hydroinformatics methods and tools, is emerging as the central paradigm for the modern water management to implement both in industrialized countries and developing countries. The European and industrialized countries have to face the maintenance and the renewal of aged water infrastructures that have to be turned into more efficient systems within a context of better resource management. The developing countries have to invest into the primary infrastructures and may benefit from the technological jump that is induced by the massive introduction of ICT solutions into the water domain in order to implement a more efficient system than the one defined and implemented by developed countries during decades. The master contents have been jointly defined in order to address this diversity of situations and to provide a holistic view of the situation in order to promote the development of relevant approaches.

Youngsters that will be considered for our EVS project are people with a wish for (personal) development that are keen on learning in an international environment. We would prefer to work with youngsters that have experience in working with youngsters (mentorship) and/or in youth projects. This way, they can compare our methods and projects to the ones they are used to \u2018back home\u2019, this will not only teach them a lot, but will also mean our organization and our people can learn a lot from them. Sail (training) experience would be nice, but by no means necessary. \r\n\r\nThe work EVS volunteers do with STAN is really diverse, which means a lot of different talents, skills and knowledge can be of use to our work and projects. The tasks and jobs the volunteer will actually be working on will depend on their personal learning goals, talents and knowledge/skills. We are there for open to participants from many different (professional) backgrounds, from practical trained and experienced sailors with an interest in the organizational side of things to, for example, someone with degree in communication or PR and a background in scouting. As already mentioned elsewhere, the actual tasks at the office will depend on what the volunteer wants to learn. This way they work on (practical skills) relevant to them and their future. It will also put them in charge of their own learning process, which is very empowering. Additionally, we know from experience that learning things in an international environment in which it is okay to make mistakes, makes a young person gain a lot more than just practical skills. The impact on the youngsters that will come work with STAN as an EVS volunteer will therefore be huge. We know from experience that joining a sail training vessel for a couple of weeks has a profound impact on youngsters, and these volunteers will do exactly that, multiple times \u00e0nd will work with us in the office, be coached, etcetera. Furthermore, they are living in another country, in a city with a lot to offer and within a culture they are not familiar with. They will be trained to be a mentor, work on ships, and so on. The volunteers will develop new skills and competences, gain knowledge on project management, and are very likely to experience a great shift in their attitude towards taking on challenges, how to be successful and, additionally, how to bring about this shift in other youngsters.

A team of highly competent trainers will implement the activity ensuring that each participant will get adequate learning guidelines and personal mentoring as well. Specific focus of the training will be made on active learning - how to understand it and to promote it when working with young people.

That conducted the project to be a best practice. \r\nTo be \u201cunited in diversity\u201d is the motto of European Union, but how to get together and confront ourself with big issues such as multiculturalism and migration it remains a difficult aim to put in practice. With MulticulturalArt we made it! \r\nThat is a reason we are want to create a second part of the same project, in a new city Pistoia, which faced up a new wave radicalization against immigration and asylum seekers. \r\nEurostat survey suggests that only 22% of European citizens believe that the European Union really represents \"cultural diversity.\" In recent years, anti-immigrant parties across the EU have ridden a wave of popular anger and the current political discourse is increasingly focused on the \"tough\" attitude on immigration. No one disputes that great changes are taking place in cities and districts in Europe today. The Pew Research, drawn from surveys conducted in April-May 2017, came out that after terrorists attacked, more than 50 per cent of people said they felt that incoming refugees increased the likelihood of terrorism in their country. Majorities in Greece, Hungary, Italy and Poland express negative attitudes toward both Muslims and refugees\u201d.  \r\n\r\nEurope is rejecting the idea that multi-culturalism is beneficial to society following a year in which the migrant crisis have boosted this sentiment across the continent. Only few agree in Europe when asked if diversity had made their country \u201ca better place to live\u201d, more than 70 per cent of people in 10 EU countries surveyed said multi-culturalism made their country either a \u201cworse\u201d place to live, or made \u201cno difference\u201d at all.\r\n\r\nPistoia is an Italian city that in 2017 was involved mostly in protest against refugees and immigration manifestation. we hear about invasion. It is imagined by Italy and Europe as a land of conquest by foreign populations. In particular young people constantly undergo a flow of information in the traditional media, but especially social media depicting danger and scaremongering against  foreigners.\r\nPromoting human rights and equality among young people is critical if we want to achieve an open, tolerant and equal society. As the adults of tomorrow, young people will shape the future. They will determine whether the nascent racism and xenophobia witnessed throughout the European Union takes a stronger hold or retreats into obscurity.\r\nThrough an exchange of one week in Pistoia (Italy) involving asylum seekers and citizens during workshops, we want to address different topics to carry out a reflection on what is multiculturalism and migration, how we can build coexistence in Europe and face problems and fears emerged in our society in recent years. Getting to know each other is the best way to find a solution all together. \r\n\r\nTo express their ideas and feelings, participants will experience various art techniques such as painting, music, theater, puppets and dance, and we will perform it in the city center.\r\nWe believe that realizing the project in Pistoia will fill the objectives for two reasons:\r\n1) Pistoia was the capital city of Italian Culture in 2017, and has turned out to be full of creative ideas and has a long history of social participation and hospitality that in recent years has been very at risk because of radicalisation.\r\n2) is a city that welcomes many foreign residents (over 30,000, about 8.7% of the total population), which places the city among the most dense in Italy with a large concentration of young immigrants from the '90.", "http://www.opportunityuk.org", null, "erasmus_2017-3-IT03-KA105-012170_5"], ["6HQ", "Tell me more", "OPPORTUNITY GLOBAL", 13723.0, "\"Tell me more\" YE will bring together 30 youngsters residing in Estonia, Romania, UK, Belarus, Georgia and Armenia to learn the basic principles of journalism and storytelling to share their stories in the media and through that to contribute to elimination of negative stereotypes about the portrait of migrant in public and mass media.

Living in a period of constant political uncertainty and major crises of social, political, economic and humanitarian character, young people today are expected to apply critical thinking and other skills to understand the nature of Europe, the agendas of different political movements and the implications of all developments on the everyday life of the individual. Propaganda, fake news and the rise of extreme political options make it even more difficult for young people to build their own opinion and they often fall victims to radical and violent groups.\r\n\r\nIn this kind of conditions, we believe that youth organizations and youth workers have to reconsider their role in supporting young people and the approaches of youth work in general. To a great extent, youth work has proven to be unsuccessful in reaching young people, especially those who are generally not interested nor involved in youth organizations, civic and non-formal education. The challenge now is how to get to those young people and what to do with them in order to help them understand the shared values of our European society and the importance of freedom, democracy, human rights and mutual respect. \r\n\r\nMain aim of this project is to equip youth workers with competencies necessary for using movie-making as a methodology in bringing the common fundamental values of our society closer to hard to reach young people and young people not involved in civic and non-formal education. Based on our previous experiences, we believe that movies can make a difference when working with those youth, and we want to help more organizations and youth workers to be effective at it. However, to be effective, youth workers and project managers need to know how make movies on values and social issues that will be interesting and appealing to young people. By putting together organizations' experiences of working with young people on exploring social issues and underlying values, and participatory processes of preparing and producing short videos for youth that target those themes, we will help organizations incorporate a new and innovative methodology that has a potential to reach a large number of young people as well as whole communities. \r\n\r\nThe Training Course will be organized in Newcastle, United Kingdom.

The initial project aimed to equip youth workers with competencies necessary for using movie-making as a methodology in bringing the common fundamental values of the European society closer to hard to reach young people and young people not involved in civic and non-formal education. Inspired by the initial success and positive outcomes of using movie-making as a methodology and joined by two new partners, a core group of organizations decided to pursue their efforts for enriching the existing youth work approaches and building wide community coalitions committed to involving hard to reach young people in discussions about the future of their communities. \r\n\r\nAlong those lines, with this project we are aiming to explore the opportunities offered by movie-making for engaging a wider population of young people into an active discussion on the fundamental European values and the present and future of Europe. Ultimately, this should result in more young people having raised awareness of the most important shared values of our society, and thus being less susceptible to becoming influenced by radical, extremist and violent structures. To achieve that, this project will need to provide space to participants to:\r\n\r\n- Become more aware of the political, social and economic changes in Europe, their influence on young people and youth understanding of the fundamental values of the common European society;\r\n- Understand the challenges posed to young people who are hard to reach, and the role of youth work in supporting those youth and bringing common European values closer to them;\r\n- Explore strategies and approaches for reaching young people who are generally not involved in civic and non-formal education and for addressing social issues and values with them;\r\n- Explore movie-making and Kino Kabaret as methods for involving young people in active exploration of common European values;\r\n- Learn about the main elements of participatory processes with youth for planning, recording, editing and producing short movies;\r\n- Explore the potential of using movie-making and the concept of Kino Kabaret for reaching to and engaging young people who are otherwise not involved;\r\n- Reflect on their own role in transferring the most fundamental European values to young people and preventing their violent radicalization.\r\n\r\nThis project is being planned at a time when Europe is facing unprecedented challenges of social, political and economic nature, that inevitably impact young people. As never before, young people today are expected to apply critical thinking and other skills to understand the nature of Europe, the agendas of different political movements and the implications of all developments on the everyday life of the individual. The most fundamental European values are being challenged and questioned on a daily basis, and young people who are beyond the reach of youth work lack support in making sense out of everything that is happening.\r\n\r\nThus, we expect that this project will strengthen organizations\u2019 human capacities for engaging more young people and bringing European values closer to them using a participative, innovative and attractive method.

In total there will be 24 participants from United Kingdom, Slovakia, Macedonia, Germany, Bulgaria and Portugal. The training course will be implemented by a team consisted of 3 trainers and 1 person responsible for logistics and practical organization. It will be hosted by the partner organization creACTive in Struga, Macedonia.\r\n\r\nFinal result of this project will be short movies that will be produced during the project, on themes related to fundamental European values that the participants will decide to work on during a Kino Kabaret process. Local young people from Struga will be actively involved in this process as well, in partnership with a local organization. The project results will be shared through a public Kino Kabaret event, where the produced short films will be presented. The project partners will further share the movies in their communities in order to impact young people, but also to motivate other youth, youth workers, organizations and film-makers to learn about film making for social purposes. The potential impact of this project goes far beyond the involved participants. Young people will have the greatest benefit, especially ones who are hard to reach through other approaches of youth work and non-formal education; but whole communities will also benefit if we succeed in bringing together individuals of different backgrounds to freely and openly discuss the main questions about what makes Europe and how our common society will shape in the future.", "http://www.opportunityuk.org", "OPPORTUNITY GLOBAL", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA105-047757_coordinator"], ["8ST", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF NORTHUMBRIA AT NEWCASTLE", 423551.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.northumbria.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF NORTHUMBRIA AT NEWCASTLE", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-047069_coordinator"], ["7RU", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE", 935738.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.newcastle.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-047181_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["8QN", "North of the Tyne CLLD Preparatory Phase", "Newcastle City Council", "The project delivers the preparatory phase of the North of the Tyne CLLD area which includes 20% of the most deprived wards in Newcastle and Wallsend in North Tyneside (population range 120,000-140,000).

The objective of the Innovation Catalyst programme is to match SMEs who are or have the potential to conduct research and innovation into new products, processes and services with current (and future) University capabilities and expertise in key technologies and sectors in alignment with national priorities and the North East Local Enterprise Partnership\u2019s (North East LEP) smart specialisation priorities.

This will be run in parallel to the Innovation Catalyst. The Innovation Accelerator will provide financial stimulus of up to \u00a320k to support research and innovation projects between SMEs, and external partners. The Innovation Accelerator scheme will stimulate R&I and enterprise projects that are either generated from the Innovation Catalyst or generated via other University and SME interactions. This will build on the University\u2019s substantial track-record of delivering business innovation funding schemes targeted at SMEs.
