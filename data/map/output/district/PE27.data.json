Through SiPs, even small or medium-sized enterprises could gain access to the development of technologically advanced, miniaturized products. However, to date, the lack of appropriate design methodologies and flows hinders the efficient development of SiPs. PARSIMO aims at enabling first time right design of heterogeneous SiP, which can contain sensors, MEMS, RF or other parts beside the micro- and nano-electronics. In order to handle complex systems, models and modelling methods will be developed which improve the modelling accuracy of sensitive SiP parts while reducing simulation time by orders of magnitude. In addition, partitioning algorithms will be investigated to enable cost, performance and power optimisation at early design stages. Furthermore, procedures for the direct data exchange to packaging tools will be developed, so that a complete design flow can be established as basis for automated, fast and cost-efficient manufacturing of SiP based products. PARSIMO aims at initiating standardization, which will open the application of SiP technology for innovative products of European SME and industry. The developed design methodology will reduce design time by several months and significantly save development costs.

This will involve a major change and improvement in the separation and decontamination of waste compared to currently existing technologies. The consortium will also consider applying the process to the light-emitting diode (LED) market, which is experiencing rapid growth.\n\nProject partners are investigating the type and cost of process equipment needed for turning CFL waste into clean glass, plastic, metal and phosphor powder. The aim is to provide a cost-efficient, low-throughput technology that can recover mercury from phosphor powder, resulting in a non-hazardous powder that can be reused. \n\nPhosphor powder contains a number of valuable rare earth metals. Therefore, the RELIGHT process will also better prepare the powder for sale to recovery facilities, enabling small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to receive a better price.\n\nAn important advantage of this approach is that all materials will be managed on one site, thereby minimising transport to specialist mercury recovery facilities. It will also enable smaller regional facilities to be run cost-effectively, replacing the vast logistics currently employed in transporting end-of-life lamps to remote recycling facilities.\n\nThe RELIGHT project will help ensure adherence to the WEEE Directive requirements and remove the growing volume of CFLs from the European waste stream.
