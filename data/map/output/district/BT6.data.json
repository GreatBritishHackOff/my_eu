Retrofittable automation has improved performance and opened the door to promising new markets.", "In rotomoulding, polymer powder or resin is placed in a hollow mould cavity and heated while rotating biaxially to coat the inside of the mould. Rotation is rather slow and coating is not through centrifugal forces. The mould is then cooled and opened and the product removed. Timing is critical. Too much time in the oven means degradation of the materials and too little means inconsistent melting and coalescence. Rapid cooling can cause the polymer to shrink and warp.\n\nCurrently, the process almost exclusively employs polyethylene (PE) due to incompatibility with the rheological characteristics of other polymers and resins. Rotomoulding of PE is used to make products ranging from toys and containers to car parts and tanks and the EU is a world leader in the field. Despite its widespread use, rotomoulding is relatively undeveloped compared to injection moulding or blow moulding. The EU-funded project http://www.rotoflex-eu.org/ (ROTOFLEX) was designed to advance rotomoulding technology and open the door to new markets. This would further enhance the international competitive position of EU small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nROTOFLEX scientists developed knowledge-based machine design and process optimisation guidelines to reinforce the supply chain. Process simulation software (RotoSim) quantifies parameters affecting behaviours such as shrinkage, residual stress and warpage. Based on a deeper understanding of equipment and process control, researchers have brought the process up to speed, so to speak. Retrofittable automated material feeding for polymers, additives and coolants enables input at any point during the process cycle. Automation not only facilitates a significant decrease in production time and energy consumption, but the precise control opens the door to a wealth of new components. Rotomoulders can now use novel materials to manufacture composite parts, including fibre-reinforced and wood\u2013polymer composite (WPC) components, and multi-layer and other value-added products.\n\nProject outcomes should positively impact the competitiveness of European SMEs in the rotomoulding sector with better control over processing and less material degradation of conventional PE components.

Misestimating of meteorological conditions or large forecasting errors (phase errors, near cut-off speeds etc), are very costly for infrastructures (i.e. unexpected loads on turbines) and reduce the value of wind energy for end-users. The state of the art in wind power forecasting focused so far on the &quot;usual&quot; operating conditions rather than on extreme events. Thus, the current wind forecasting technology presents several strong bottlenecks. End-users urge for dedicated approaches to reduce large prediction errors or predict extremes at local scale (gusts, shears) up to a European scale as extremes and forecast errors may propagate. Similar concerns arise from the fields of external conditions and resource assessment, where the aim is to minimize project failure. The aim of this project is to substantially improve wind power predictability in challenging or extreme situations and at different temporal and spatial scales. Going beyond this, wind predictability is considered as a system design parameter linked to the resource assessment phase, where the aim is to take optimal decisions for the installation of a new wind farm. The project concentrates on: using new measuring devices for a more detailed knowledge of the wind speed and energy available at local level; develop strong synergy with research in meteorology; develop new operational methods for the very-short-term for warning/alerting that use coherently collected meteorological and wind power data distributed over Europe to early detect and forecast extreme events; develop models to improve medium term wind predictability; develop a European vision of wind forecasting taking advantage of existing operational forecasting installations at various European end-users.
