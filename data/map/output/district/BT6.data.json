Retrofittable automation has improved performance and opened the door to promising new markets.", "In rotomoulding, polymer powder or resin is placed in a hollow mould cavity and heated while rotating biaxially to coat the inside of the mould. Rotation is rather slow and coating is not through centrifugal forces. The mould is then cooled and opened and the product removed. Timing is critical. Too much time in the oven means degradation of the materials and too little means inconsistent melting and coalescence. Rapid cooling can cause the polymer to shrink and warp.\n\nCurrently, the process almost exclusively employs polyethylene (PE) due to incompatibility with the rheological characteristics of other polymers and resins. Rotomoulding of PE is used to make products ranging from toys and containers to car parts and tanks and the EU is a world leader in the field. Despite its widespread use, rotomoulding is relatively undeveloped compared to injection moulding or blow moulding. The EU-funded project http://www.rotoflex-eu.org/ (ROTOFLEX) was designed to advance rotomoulding technology and open the door to new markets. This would further enhance the international competitive position of EU small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nROTOFLEX scientists developed knowledge-based machine design and process optimisation guidelines to reinforce the supply chain. Process simulation software (RotoSim) quantifies parameters affecting behaviours such as shrinkage, residual stress and warpage. Based on a deeper understanding of equipment and process control, researchers have brought the process up to speed, so to speak. Retrofittable automated material feeding for polymers, additives and coolants enables input at any point during the process cycle. Automation not only facilitates a significant decrease in production time and energy consumption, but the precise control opens the door to a wealth of new components. Rotomoulders can now use novel materials to manufacture composite parts, including fibre-reinforced and wood\u2013polymer composite (WPC) components, and multi-layer and other value-added products.\n\nProject outcomes should positively impact the competitiveness of European SMEs in the rotomoulding sector with better control over processing and less material degradation of conventional PE components.

The state of the art in wind power forecasting focused so far on the &quot;usual&quot; operating conditions rather than on extreme events. Thus, the current wind forecasting technology presents several strong bottlenecks. End-users urge for dedicated approaches to reduce large prediction errors or predict extremes at local scale (gusts, shears) up to a European scale as extremes and forecast errors may propagate. Similar concerns arise from the fields of external conditions and resource assessment, where the aim is to minimize project failure. The aim of this project is to substantially improve wind power predictability in challenging or extreme situations and at different temporal and spatial scales. Going beyond this, wind predictability is considered as a system design parameter linked to the resource assessment phase, where the aim is to take optimal decisions for the installation of a new wind farm. The project concentrates on: using new measuring devices for a more detailed knowledge of the wind speed and energy available at local level; develop strong synergy with research in meteorology; develop new operational methods for the very-short-term for warning/alerting that use coherently collected meteorological and wind power data distributed over Europe to early detect and forecast extreme events; develop models to improve medium term wind predictability; develop a European vision of wind forecasting taking advantage of existing operational forecasting installations at various European end-users.

Special personalised  attention is given  to students according to their needs and  diversity, which are highly valued.The school has been developing the Emotional Competence Project since 2008 and later, in 2013 we secured the 2nd Educative Innovation Award from our Educational Community Goverment,\"Premios Joaqu\u00edn Sama\".Since this project,based on Social and Emotional learning, was implemented in our school,there have been several positive effects on diverse students with and without emotional and behavioural difficulties.The cross-curricular project activities have been integrated in regular class curriculum and extra-curricular activities and developed gradually by teachers and pupils.The school Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) cross-curricular project includes activities in different subjects and a special effort will be made to ensure its implementation in the Bilingual Section. Bearing in mind all mentioned above,our school has  strongly pointed out the need for further learning and sharing of our knowledge on SEL with other European Schools,especially those that need to develop quality school programmes that will improve the basic and transversal skills of students and school staff and combat dropout rates,social exclusion and poverty. To accomplish this goal,participants need to attend linguistic training courses to enable them to understand foreign languages and cultures, develop teachers' communicative and linguistic competences and  observe new methodologies in other European institutions so that they may promote innovation.These courses enable teachers to maintain a higher level of contact, and  also help build  strategic partnerships in a future Key Action 2 (KA2). They foster an environment that encourages innovation and the exchange of good practices.Regarding bilingualism, our institution has had an English Blingual Section  for two years. Currently, there are four staff members who teach non-linguistic subjects in two diferent educational levels of Compulsory Secondary Education: Mathematics, Technology, Physical Education and  Arts. Staff members will gradually join the bilingual section as it spreads to other educational levels in the future. In order to spread bilingualism throughout the school, it will first be necessary to provide  the teachers with foreign languages and non-linguistic subject training; this will ensure teachers have more practice with languages, develop communicative,linguistic and cultural skills,and implement  CLIL methodology creating new resources.To satisfy the identified needs, we are applying for six members of our teaching staff to participate in formative activities.The teachers involved in the project are teachers of English, Mathematics, History and Geography  and also the Coordinator of the \"Emotional Competence Project,Special Needs teacher.The participants and some others from the teaching staff will be in charge of writing the programme,selecting the candidates and they will organize all the preparatory activities previous to the the mobilities, the assessment and impact of the training activities,as well as the dissemination process according to needs.In order to fulfill the project,the participants have begun B1and B2 level English courses to receive certification of language competences.They are also attending workshops that involve creation of CLIL materials.
