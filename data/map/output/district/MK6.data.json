As part of the boreholing process, remediation chemicals will be introduced in to the ground contained within a geotextile sock. Diffusion of the chemicals (oxygen release compounds, hydrogen release compounds, zero-valent iron or chemical oxidants) occurs through the permeable geotextile material. Injection target cycle time will be = 5 mins from hole to hole at 1m spacing. The spacing of these boreholes will be decided by the concentration of contaminant and the required rate of clean-up. This whole system will be passive, i.e. requiring no energy to function after installation or operator maintenance. A range of equipment options are envisaged, from simple attachments for existing excavation plant \ufffd which will be the primary focus of HEISTT , enabling rapid take up of the process by SMEs due to the affordability of retrofit - through to dedicated bespoke machinery.", 250302.0, 1586316.0, "HEISTT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.dcpuk.com", null, "fp7_96169_991607624"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["5LD", "RD8", "MILTON KEYNES HOSPITAL"], ["5LD", "RTH", "MILTON KEYNES GENERAL HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "MK6"}
