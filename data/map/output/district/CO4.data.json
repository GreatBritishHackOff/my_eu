Yet little has been done to understand how or whether it worked on the ground and what difficulties and contradictions emerged in its implementation. Likewise, there are no in-depth studies of the internationally acclaimed Anti-Schistosomiasis Campaign in Mao\u2019s China. A comparison of the latter, a top-down initiative with a biomedical \u2018magic bullet\u2019 to deliver, with the former, a more general public health campaign focused on education, hygiene and the provision of basic health care, will bring out the complex interface between local everyday health strategies and state provision of both modern allopathic medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Capitalizing on the recently opening of party archives as well as newly collected oral interviews, this project intends to move away from a narrow focus on party politics and policy formulation by examining the reality of health care at the local level and the challenges faced by local authorities and individuals as the campaigns evolved.

The overall aim of the project is to understand the processes through which better standards of health care were conceived and the different contexts in which they have and can be evaluated.

Establish a robust operational framework that will ensure the logistic integrity of EuroCohort.\n\nThe culmination of ECDP is in the creation of an infrastructural platform with a commitment from key stakeholders across Europe and from which the next stages in finalising EuroCohort can begin. \n\nThere is at present no equivalent data source available to scientists to comparatively analyse the well-being of children as they grow up and therefore to develop policies to improve their well-being.  As the respondents to EuroCohort grow up an increasing body of data will develop, becoming ever richer and informative, able to show the ways in which national policies have made impacts and showing where policy interventions can make significant improvements.  \n\nECDP has a tripartite focus on securing political support, operational robustness and scientific excellence.  We recognise that each of these imperatives are necessary to the development of a successful research infrastructure, as scientific excellence alone is not enough.

Since then, additional cases of ambiguous anaphoric reference have been found; and similar findings have been made for other aspects of language interpretation, including wordsense disambiguation, and even part-of-speech tagging. Using the Phrase Detectives Game-With-A-Purpose to collect massive amounts of judgments online, we found that up to 30% of anaphoric expressions in our data are ambiguous.
