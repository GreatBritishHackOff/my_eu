Management includes medication and/or lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. At the same time, it should be noted that chronic diseases may get worse, lead to death, be cured, remain dormant or require continual monitoring. CHRONIOUS primary goal is to define a European framework for a generic health status monitoring platform schema addressing people with chronic health conditions. This will be achieved by developing an intelligent, ubiquitous and adaptive chronic disease platform to be used by both patients and healthcare professionals. CHRONIOUS addresses a smart wearable platform, based on multi-parametric sensor data processing, for monitoring people suffering from chronic diseases in long-stay setting. It is constantly monitoring their activity using audio observation methods and activity sensors while at the same time tracking their medical condition via vital signs sensors. Any trait of abnormal health status and possible alerting incidents are detected by CHRONIOUS Intelligence.  The system generates alerts in case of invalid medical data or if current activity and behaviour lay outside the well established activity patterns and locomotion behaviour. Furthermore, CHRONIOUS objective is to face Europe's challenge for delivering quality healthcare to all its citizens by offering a ubiquitous and more personalised care solution that addresses the user needs, personal data security, confidentiality and privacy of information and all that at an affordable cost. Our proposed solution will be applied to the chronic diseases of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Renal Insufficiency.", null, 8781338.0, "CHRONIOUS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_85452_999672592"], ["4AZ", "HIGH PERFORMANCES PREDICTION, DETECTION AND MONITORING PLATFORM FOR PATIENT SAFETY RISK MANAGEMENT", "Quality and Systems Consulting Ltd", "According to recent studies, Risks Against Patient Safety (RAPS) represent one of the most important  factors of dead in hospitals: during therapy, more then 8% of patients recovered in hospitals suffer for additional disease that in almost 50% of the cases produce either dead or significant additional health problems. RAPS occur in any stage of the patient care process.REMINE project idea originates from the common difficulty in conducting a analysis, early identification and effective prevention on RAP when there are significant mass of inhomogeneous data sources, stored in multimedia databases, and a distributed environments with different care professionals contemporary involved.To contrast the RAPS trends and the malpractices diffusion, REMINE prosecutes a number of main objectives. a new technological platform, new care process organizational requirements. Main elements are: mining of multimedia data; modeling, prediction, detection of RAPS, RAPS management support system and info broker patient safety framework.Main outcomes of REMINE will be: time reduction in collecting data, time reduction in RAPS analysis, standardization of common language, evolution in the interaction model, reference framework, patient safety improvement, health care cost saving (within an estimated RAPS reduction between 6% to 9% of RAPS.", null, 6342340.0, "REMINE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_85438_999672592"], ["4LT", "Next generation 3D print technology (PICSIMA), which for the first time enables the direct full colour printing of silicone to make soft tissue prostheses, orthoses and removable partial dentures.", "Fripp Design Limited", "Prostheses are artificial body parts, which can also be soft tissue such as the nose and ears, and orthoses are external artificial devices for supporting the limbs or spine or to prevent/assist relative movement. The current manufacturing process of these involves first taking an impression from the patient, making the mould, hand painting it and then modifying it to fit. The making of moulds is prone to error and occasionally leads to sub-optimal designs involving re-makes, alterations and repairs. Moulding also has severe constraints particularly where complex geometries and thin walled parts are required and it does not allow for varying of softness and tear strength within the moulded part. The multiplicity of stages in the manufacture of these custom parts makes the moulding process very expensive and time consuming. Fripp Design and Research, one of Europe's leading providers of innovative 3D print solutions, seeks to commercialise a new method for the rapid manufacture of soft tissue prostheses by developing the world\u2019s first full colour silicone 3D Printer to replace the current moulding manufacturing method that is time consuming, highly variable and very costly. The use of faster and highly accurate 3D printing technology in the medical devices industry will not only lower costs by up to 72% but will also open up new design freedoms that prior to this were only dreams. The 3D printer developed can also be used in making orthoses and removable partial dentures (RPD) frameworks using silicone. The market opportunity goes beyond medical devices, into the high growth industrial gaskets and seals, where the market size surpasses \u20ac20 billion. The Feasibility Study will establish the technological and manufacturing capabilities of the printing device and determine the potential medical and industrial markets for the application of our product.
