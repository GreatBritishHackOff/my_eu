NIHL results in reduced productivity from lost work days, insurance claims and potential early retirement. Current EU legislation requires employers to provide suitable ear protection for workers exposed to high levels of noise, but worker compliance is often low as they perceive the use of hearing protection as impairing hearing capability. Thus a suitable alternative to existing ear protection is needed, allowing speech and alarms to be heard whilst significantly reducing other potentially harmful sound. In summary the PiezoSelEx device will: \u2022 Promote productivity due to easier communication \u2022 Reduce the risk of NIHL \u2022 Contribute to a more comfortable work environment \u2022 Reduce employee absenteeism due to increased wearer comfort and a reduction in NIHL \u2022 Contribute to a safer working environment as warning signals will be easier to hear. The use of piezo materials in this proposal has many advantages over prior art of high end earplugs. The novel use of \u2018piezo pairs\u2019 self-powers the earplug, thus eliminating the need for external electrical equipment as is required by all current piezo earplugs. Furthermore, the use of sets of piezo pairs not only enables the device to cancel out all noise above 75 dB (A), but also \u2018filter\u2019 out background noise except for sound frequencies associated with speech and warning signals. The use of piezo pairs removes the need for batteries, thus having positive environmental implications. Ergonomic and safety testing of the prototype will take place to ensure maximum comfort and safety for users over extended periods of time. There are also a number of wider benefits for Europe. In addition to working environments currently protected by legislation our device may provide a driver to enforce new legislations, particularly in the entertainment industry.", 214791.0, 1228074.0, "PIEZOSELEX", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_97069_983612011"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5DB", "Language & Literacy at Linaker", "Linaker Primary School", 22451.0, "With 528 pupils, Linaker is a larger than average-sized primary school. We are a growing school, and pupils numbers are increasing yearly. In the past we  had just 2 classes per year group.  Now Reception & KS1 have 3 classes,  years 1&2 have 2.5 classes,  year 3 has 3 classes, and  years 4,5 & 6 have 2 classes.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of pupils who come from minority ethnic groups , those who speak English as an additional language and  disadvantaged pupils supported by pupil premium funding, are higher than the national average.  \r\n\r\nOur school has in the past been very much involved in international activities and we have seen the very positive benefits that this can bring. Our previous Comenius Regio project showed us how cooperation between schools in different countries can benefit all. We made positive changes to our school as a result of the project, as did our partner schools.\r\n\r\nLinaker is a global school with a high number of EAL pupils. We are known for good practice in the teaching of English to EAL pupils and wish to mirror this success with the teaching of MFL. Our EAL pupils are particularly receptive to learning new languages and we see languages as a way in which these pupils can shine and achieve success, building their confidence and self-esteem. We need to raise the attainment of our EAL pupils and see this project as being a way of doing this.\r\n\r\nWe have a high proportion of disadvantaged children with a very limited knowledge of the world around them. We need to give them opportunities and experiences to widen their knowledge and understanding of the world and improve their attainment.\r\n\r\nThe greatest strategic need is to move from our current provision involving one member of staff taking responsibility for language teaching across the school without much link to other subjects, to a much more effective model whereby class teachers plan, teach and assess MFL alongside all of the curriculum subjects. This will result in pupils having more exposure to the target language and an increase in attainment. The status of languages will change and it will no longer be considered an add-on subject. It will become part of our whole school thematic approach to teaching.\r\n\r\nThese project objectives are very much in line with our whole school priorities as outlined in our School Development Plan.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the most effective way to meet our schools needs will be through a two-year project which will involve immersion training courses in Spain.\r\n\r\nParticipants will be from both key stages and also from different roles (TA, teacher, SMT) to develop the whole school ethos and approach to language learning.\r\n\r\nWe have chosen courses that include elements of language learning, culture and methodology and also allow participants to take part in professional discussions and spend time visiting a partner school in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe 12 mobilities will be spread evenly across the two years of the project. Roughly, they will be as follows:\r\n\r\nVisit 1 : 2x HLTAs, Member of SLT\r\nVisit 2 : MFL coordinator,  HLTA & SLT\r\nVisit 3 : SLT & ks1 & ks2 teaching staff \r\nVisit 4 : SLT & ks1 & ks2 teaching staff\r\n\r\nThe impact of this project will be far reaching and long lasting. Initially, the impact will be on the staff concerned, their increased confidence, abilities and skills in language teaching. It will then spread to other members of staff, our children and their experience of languages, and our wider community including parents, other schools and Governors.", "http://www.linakerschool.co.uk", "Linaker Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035487_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["6PN", "RBN", "SOUTHPORT AND FORMBY DISTRICT GENERAL HOSPITAL"], ["6PN", "REM", "UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL AINTREE OUTPOSTED NEPHROLOGY CLINIC"], ["6PN", "RET", "SOUTHPORT & FORMBY DISTRICT GENERAL HOSPITAL (S&O TRUST)"], ["6PN", "RTV", "SOUTHPORT & FORMBY DISTRICT GENERAL HOSPITAL"], ["6PN", "RVY", "SOUTHPORT & FORMBY DISTRICT GENERAL HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PR8"}
