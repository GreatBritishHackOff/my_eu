Our proposal focuses first on the emerging uses of the web as a tool of collective endeavour and public debate, then on engaging actors involved in two particular technoscientific issues (aging/life expectancy and climate change adaptation) in an \u2018open-air\u2019 experiment using online interactive platforms that will be designed and developed within the project.\n\nIn the domain of science-society interactions, the aim of EMAPS is to get a better understanding of whether the web can provide a meaningful equipment to produce an enhanced interest of a wider public, not as receivers of information about end results of science, but as potential participants in science in the making. Particularly for controversial topics like climate change, the present EU call underlines the potential as well as the risks of the explosion of online communication and the proliferation of producers and consumers of scientific information. To cope with this situation, EMAPS, coordinated by Prof. Bruno Latour at Sciences Po in Paris, proposes an innovative model to trace the heterogeneous networks constituted around science and technology issues. Accordingly, the involvement of  different publics will come from equipping scientists, journalists, activists, corporations and citizens with a political atlas mapping their disagreements on science and technology.

In Mondrian More Mobilities we want to send the entire management for an internship abroad.\r\nStudents Erasmus+ program works efficiently. The school plans activity from the curriculum. Its implementation may be abroad and we are thankful for the grant opportunity.\r\n\r\nFor employees, it is difficult. Of course professionalisation is planned but the question of a  course abroad or in house is not yet commonly asked. Especially when Erasmus+ funding can be involved. In the construction phase, the \"delay\" of waiting for the next call takes too much time. Waiting for a wanted course is no good for professionalisation.\r\nWe get many requests from abroad to assist in a particular topic unexpectedly. Naturally Mondrian used its own resources. But for the further development and consciousness we would be able to mention this kind of requests in te application in  such a way that it fits in the subsidy program without being very specific. Over time, it will be like when students work with specific partners. The amount of courses by Mondrian makes it difficult to realize such application, certainly in the beginning.", "http://www.mirjamrouden.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA116-035042_7"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8DD", "STURGIS CARBON PROFILING LLP", 218.0, "Other management expenditure (07.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_25045", 2016], ["8QA", "OURMALA", 46474.0, "Pilot project \u2014 Promoting health-enhancing physical activity across Europe (15.02.77.10)", "fts_2016_56032", 2016], ["8DD", "PLUSVALUE", 1293.0, "Horizon 2020 \u2014 Customer-driven scientific and technical support to Union policies (10.02.01)", "fts_2016_63228", 2016], ["9PJ", "ASHOKA UK", 238378.0, "Appropriations accruing from contributions from (non-European Economic Area) third parties to research and technological development (2014 to 2020) (15.03.50.01)", "fts_2017_12304", 2017], ["8DD", "PLUSVALUE", 181756.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_15505", 2017], ["8DD", "PLUSVALUE", 910.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the \u2018Research and innovation\u2019 policy area (08.01.05)", "fts_2017_22222", 2017], ["6EH", "D&AD", 87225.0, "Culture -programme \u2014 Supporting cross-border actions and promoting transnational circulation and mobility (15.04.02)", "fts_2017_39914", 2017], ["8DD", "PLUSVALUE", 171.0, "Other management expenditure (01.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_50713", 2017], ["8DD", "PLUSVALUE", 60011.0, "Horizon 2020 \u2014 Customer-driven scientific and technical support to Union policies (10.02.01)", "fts_2017_53635", 2017], ["9DG", "EYE PRESENT LIMITED", 52335.0, "MEDIA -programme \u2014 Operating transnationally and internationally and promoting transnational circulation and mobility (09.05.01)", "fts_2017_55007", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "E2"}
