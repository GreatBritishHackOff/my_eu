CAPITAL will help CIVITAS to build the bridge towards a more advanced identity within Horizon 2020. It will help to create a more structured link with large-scale deployment in support of Transport White Paper goals. The CAPITAL strategic goals are:\n\n1. To  consolidate existing knowledge and lessons learnt and to provide recommendations for successful continuation of CIVITAS,\n\n2. To create a dynamic knowledge centre as a means of structured dialogue and exchange among CIVITAS stakeholders,\n\n3. To facilitate a structured transfer of CIVITAS measures based on practical experiences,\n\n4. To establish and manage national/ regional CIVITAS networks serving as delivery channels and activation mechanism of stakeholders,\n\n5.

Electrification is driven by both economics and politics. However, although technology is not yet fully matured and ready for wide commercialisation,  a large demonstration project will facilitate the market up-take of electric buses in Europe. Furthermore, as unambiguous and extensive information about overall effects of electrified bus systems and related needs for changes on infrastructure do not exist today, UITP sees its objectives and those matching perfectly, and this led UITP to build a consortium of 40 partners, who were already considering their actions along this theme, and to collectively design the 42-months demonstration project ZeEUS \u2013 Zero-Emission Urban Bus Systems.\n\nZeEUS project focus on the today's challenge in the electrification of bus system, the extension of the fully-electric solution to a wider part of the urban network.

The current transport system is powered by 95% petroleum products and is accountable for about 23% of the global energy related CO2 emissions. The potential for achieving a measurable impact by improved transportation processes within supply chains on the worldwide scale is therefore huge.\nIn the past, carbon footprint calculation obligations did not exist in the sector of transport and logistics, neither on national nor on international levels. Approaches were taken by individual organizations and corporations to develop methods, tools and databases for emission calculations. These approaches vary hugely though, and today a wide range of different methodologies and tools are applied by the various players to calculate their CO2 emissions often focusing on a specific mode of transport. Furthermore different databases are used to calculate emissions with some calculations being based on data measured by individual companies and organizations, others being based on default data provided by public sources (e.g. HBEFA, COPERT 4). Various calculation tools apply different indicators and have different application scopes, often making comparison of the results impossible. In order to analyse the efficiency and effectiveness of different supply chains however, such comparability is required: comparison on shippers\u2019 level, on transport mode level, on shipment level, on carrier level, on product level as well as over time are needed in order to identify best practice and improvement possibilities as well as to analyse the impact of amendments to existing processes.

This is the overall goal of the http://www.cofret-project.eu/ ('Carbon footprint of freight transport') (COFRET) project.\n\nCurrently, varying methodologies and tools as well as different databases are being used for carbon footprint calculations. This non-standardised approach means individual companies and organisations apply different measurements and indicators, making it difficult to compare results. Comparability, however, is necessary for analysing the efficiency and effectiveness of different supply chains. This applies to shippers, transport modes, carriers and products. Setting such a base would facilitate identification of best practices and highlight possibilities for improvement, as well as allow an analysis of the impact of changes to existing processes.\n\nIn the first reporting period, the team analysed existing CO2 emission calculation methods and tools. They also established links with the most relevant stakeholders. These two complementary actions help to bridge an important research and knowledge gap. To ensure the relevance of their work for potential end users, team members engaged with the project's external advisory board. The board's representatives hail from diverse organisations and are committed to enhancing the added value of COFRET efforts through close collaboration and reviews of project deliverables.\n\nWhile the project was in progress, two first approaches were released for European and international standards (EN16258 and ISO\u00a014067) for the calculation of CO2 emissions. These developments prompted COFRET to revise its future scope of work and planned actions, so as to account for these standards for calculating the carbon footprint of products.\n\nGoing forward, the consortium's work is focused on the acceptance and use of the newly introduced standards by industry and other stakeholders.

Despite stringent health & safety standards over 50% of UK road workers reported a near miss with a vehicle and the large majority of injuries or fatalities occur within designated safety areas. These safe zones are either protected by positive protection systems such as concrete barriers or soft barriers such as traffic cones. The latter are mainly used for temporary works. In such a scenario cones may be the only protection a road worker has from traffic. Due to the maturity of Europe\u2019s road network and the rapid deterioration as a result of heavy traffic and weather conditions, temporary road work is increasing. In addition to concerns about safety, preparation of these temporary barriers is a major drain on resources. As a lot of roadwork is carried out at night, barriers are equipped with lanterns. These are typically powered by disposable batteries which only last a short period of time and have to be changed frequently. The Safelane consortium have successfully developed  a wireless perimeter protection system that detects an impact to a temporary barrier. However,  there are several significant technical hurdles that currently prevent the development of a system that can be applied to every road maintenance scenario. In Safelane we propose to develop an all-encompassing system including; a Smart re-chargeable lantern battery with integrated wireless impact sensor; a Smart alarm base station capable of receiving alerts from individual impact sensors, to warn the workforce; and a device management system enabling road maintenance contractors to effectively manage temporary work sites via a web based graphical user interface.

Based on existing Intellicone technology, which employs sensors, lighting and wireless communications to enhance the safety of temporary work zones, the project is working on an improved solution to roadwork.\n\nMore specifically, the project team is developing an innovative battery system that can be charged in\u00a0situ. It is bringing cost efficiency and reliability to roadwork sites, in addition to avoiding use of millions of batteries that end up in landfills or that are destined for recycling. SAFELANE is also integrating its safety system with current road maintenance and management computer networks and systems in order to achieve more cost savings and better reporting of incidents.\n\nAlready, the team has enhanced the Intellicone technology with improved data-logging mechanisms and sensors for vehicle impacts.
