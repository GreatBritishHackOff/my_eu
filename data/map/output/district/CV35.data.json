Thus, RLW Navigator will crucially serve as an enabler for future energy efficient smart factories. RLW is emerging as a promising joining technology for sheet metal assembly due to benefits on several fronts including reduced processing time, (50-75%) and decreased factory floor footprint (50%), reduced environmental impact through energy use reduction (60%), and providing a flexible process base for future model introduction or product change. Currently, RLW systems are limited in their applicability due to an acute lack of systematic ICT-based simulation methodologies to navigate their efficient application in automotive manufacturing processes. The project aims to address this by developing a Process Navigator simulation system that will deal with three key challenges thereby allowing manufacturers to utilize the advantages of the RLW system.Firstly, the most critical obstacle that currently prevents the successful implementation of RLW is the need for tight dimensional control of part-to-part gap during joining operations, essential to ensure the quality of the stitch.Secondly, the existing assembly system architecture must be reconfigured to provide the opportunity to evaluate the RLW system in terms of its feasibility to perform all required assembly tasks. This will provide crucial information about the most advantageous workstation/cell reconfiguration, which will serve as the basis for optimal robot path planning to reduce joining process time and workstation level efficiency assessment.Finally the project will develop systematic evaluation and learning methods to assess and improve the overall performance, cost-effectiveness and eco-efficiency of the RLW system.", 135718.0, 5416569.0, "RLW Navigator", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_100030_966852448"], ["0RR", "Electric-VEhicle Control of individual wheel Torque for On- and Off-Road Conditions (E-VECTOORC)", "Land Rover", "The E-VECTOORC project brings together 11 complementary partners from industrial and research backgrounds to address the individual control of the electric motor torques of fully electric vehicles to enhance safety, comfort and fun-to-drive in both on- and off-road driving conditions. The key objectives of the proposal are:\u0095 Development and demonstration of yaw rate and sideslip angle control algorithms based on the combination of front/rear and left/right torque vectoring to improve overall vehicle dynamic performance.\u0095 Development and demonstration of novel strategies for the modulation of the torque output of the individual electric motors to enhance brake energy recuperation, Anti lock Brake function and Traction Control function. The benefits of these strategies include reductions in: i) vehicle energy consumption, ii) stopping distance, and iii) acceleration times.All developed algorithms will include failsafe strategies and controlled shutdown procedures. The overall control strategy will employ a modular control architecture to allow an easy implementation for different vehicle layouts (e.g., the number of individually controlled motors), vehicle sizes and vehicle applications (from small city cars to sports cars and SUVs).The activity will be carried out using vehicle dynamics simulations and Hardware-In-the-Loop testing of vehicle components and subsystems, which will be complemented by full scale experimental testing of the entire system using a highly versatile vehicle demonstrator that can represent drivetrain architectures with 2, 3 or 4 electric motors. Experimental testing will provide comprehensive information for quantifying the benefits of the proposed control system in both on-road and off-road driving conditions.Hence, in line with the ICT Work Programme for FEVs, the potential of electric drive architectures for improving vehicle stability control will be more fully exploited and measured through the E-VECTOORC control approach.", 162236.0, 3971886.0, "E-VECTOORC", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_99412_966852448"], ["7QB", "Multi-Modal Situation Assessment & Analytics Platform", "Warwickshire Police", "MOSAIC Platform will involve multi-modal data intelligence capture and analytics including video and text collaterals etc. The distributed intelligence within the platform enables decision support for automated detection, recognition, geo-location and mapping, including intelligent decision support at various levels to enhance situation awareness, surveillance targeting and camera handover; these involve level one fusion, and situation understanding to enable decision support and impact analysis at level two and three of situation assessment.
