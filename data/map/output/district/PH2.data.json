The concept of the BiFFiO project is to mix the waste readily available from fish farms and manure waste from the agriculture industry in a reactor for production of biogas, which in turn can be used to fill the need for renewable energy in the aquaculture industry and supply fertilizer products to the agriculture industry. The BiFFiO project partners see great opportunities for business development in production of renewable energy from mixed agriculture and aquaculture waste. The main BiFFiO project objectives are 1) Development of a new best practice and novel technology for handling mixed waste from aquaculture and agriculture for production of energy, and further use of the digested waste, 2) Development from current large scale state-of-the art technologies for treating animal waste, to an economical, efficient and scalable three-stage system of pre-treatment, biogas reactor and fertilizer recuperation, which can be located at or in the vicinity of most near shore and on-shore fish farm operations, 3) Application of new technology in the agriculture industry alone or together with fish farming industry, on both remote and central locations to save costs for waste transport and deposition, 4) Impact on socio-economic conditions through the benefits of improved hygienic and environmental standards of closed fish farming and by reduced greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution burdens from the agriculture sector. Five SME AGs and seven Other SME and end user partners from the agriculture, aquaculture and bio-energy sector will take part in the project together with three RTD partners, Teknologisk Institutt (NO), University of Liverpool (UK)  and aqua consult Ingenieur (DE), who will be performing the BiFFiO RTD work.", 187759.0, 1826928.0, "BIFFIO", null, null, null, null, "http://www.scottishsalmon.co.uk", null, "fp7_110696_952802095"], ["8DG", "Advancing understanding of Atlantic Salmon at Sea: Merging Genetics and Ecology to resolve Stock-specific Migration and Distribution patterns", "Atlantic Salmon Trust", "Over the past two decades, an increasing proportion of North Atlantic salmon are dying at sea during their oceanic feeding migration. The specific reasons for the decline in this important species are as yet unknown, however, climate change is likely to be an important factor. In some rivers in the southern part of the salmons range, wild salmon now face extinction. This is in spite of unprecedented management measures to halt this decline. Arguably the greatest challenge in salmon conservation is to gain insight into the spatial and ecological use of the marine environment by different regional and river stocks, which are known to show variation in marine growth, condition, and survival. Salmon populations may migrate to different marine zones, whose environmental conditions may vary. To date it has been impossible to sample and identify the origin of sufficient numbers of wild salmon at sea to enable this vital question to be addressed. SALSEA-Merge will provide the basis for advancing our understanding of oceanic-scale, ecological and ecosystem processes. Such knowledge is fundamental to the future sustainable management of this key marine species. Through a partnership of 9 European nations the programme will deliver innovation in the areas of: genetic stock identification techniques, new genetic marker development, fine scale estimates of growth on a weekly and monthly basis, the use of novel high seas pelagic trawling technology and individual stock linked estimates of food and feeding patterns. In addition, the use of the three-dimensional Regional Ocean Modelling System, merging hydrography, oceanographic, genetic and ecological data, will deliver novel stock specific migration and distribution models. This widely supported project, provides the basis for a comprehensive investigation into the problems facing salmon at sea. It will also act as an important model for understanding the factors affecting survival of many other important marine species.", null, 4833604.0, "SALSEA-MERGE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.atlanticsalmontrust.org", null, "fp7_87925_998795033"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7QB", "French Language Immersion Course  (Lyon)- Spanish Language Immersion Course", "Errol Primary School", 5526.0, "The project participants hope to be able to provide a more comprehensive, structured and progressive approach  to embedding the teaching and learning of Modern languages throughout all stages of the primary setting. Participants will gain greater confidence and expertise in the teaching of Modern Foreign Languages and will be able to share their new expertise with all educators within the school community.  This will allow French to be fully embedded within our school prior to the introduction of the second language in 2020.    We will collaborate to establish breadth and depth to the language learning experience beyond the four core skills to encourage a more holistic approach to language learning. We will provide a cohesive and progressive plan through the stages by reflective evaluative practice and through peer and Senior Leadership Team observations, as well as including the pupil voice in our plans by sharing their experiences with others and staff.\r\n\r\nIn a school of this size, having more trained staff in the first of the introduced Modern Languages (French) will give the opportunity for the participant attending the Spanish Immersion course to begin putting in place resources and training for the second language (Spanish) to be introduced in P5 in line with EU policy.  With a focus on providing the language used by our feeder secondary school we hope to enable our pupils to transition from Primary to Secondary education with more confidence.\r\n\r\nAs the 1+2 approach moves towards the deadline for introducing the second language by 2020 we will  have an enhanced ability to teach Modern Foreign Languages, we will disseminate learning, resources and methodology to fellow professionals and embed the target language within the school. All resources gathered from the course will be used to form a central bank of resources for staff members to access following training.\r\nWe will ensure that the target languages are made more visible throughout the school building and will be used across the curriculum, for example, within Mathematics, PE and Expressive Arts.\r\n\r\nWe  will deliver presentations and workshops for fellow colleagues, parents and the wider school community. We will update our School Handbook and school website to reflect the school emphasis on Modern Foreign Languages.  We will invite other professionals to attend and share our French Week experience. \r\n\r\nQuestionnaires and feedback will be sought from all stakeholders; the planning and implementation of a more rigorous approach to modern language teaching and learning  will be added to the Quality Assurance Calendar.", null, "Errol Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036245_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PH2"}
