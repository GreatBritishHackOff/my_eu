The concept of the BiFFiO project is to mix the waste readily available from fish farms and manure waste from the agriculture industry in a reactor for production of biogas, which in turn can be used to fill the need for renewable energy in the aquaculture industry and supply fertilizer products to the agriculture industry. The BiFFiO project partners see great opportunities for business development in production of renewable energy from mixed agriculture and aquaculture waste. The main BiFFiO project objectives are 1) Development of a new best practice and novel technology for handling mixed waste from aquaculture and agriculture for production of energy, and further use of the digested waste, 2) Development from current large scale state-of-the art technologies for treating animal waste, to an economical, efficient and scalable three-stage system of pre-treatment, biogas reactor and fertilizer recuperation, which can be located at or in the vicinity of most near shore and on-shore fish farm operations, 3) Application of new technology in the agriculture industry alone or together with fish farming industry, on both remote and central locations to save costs for waste transport and deposition, 4) Impact on socio-economic conditions through the benefits of improved hygienic and environmental standards of closed fish farming and by reduced greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution burdens from the agriculture sector. Five SME AGs and seven Other SME and end user partners from the agriculture, aquaculture and bio-energy sector will take part in the project together with three RTD partners, Teknologisk Institutt (NO), University of Liverpool (UK)  and aqua consult Ingenieur (DE), who will be performing the BiFFiO RTD work.", 187759.0, 1826928.0, "BIFFIO", null, null, null, null, "http://www.scottishsalmon.co.uk", null, "fp7_110696_952802095"], ["8DG", "Advancing understanding of Atlantic Salmon at Sea: Merging Genetics and Ecology to resolve Stock-specific Migration and Distribution patterns", "Atlantic Salmon Trust", "Over the past two decades, an increasing proportion of North Atlantic salmon are dying at sea during their oceanic feeding migration. The specific reasons for the decline in this important species are as yet unknown, however, climate change is likely to be an important factor. In some rivers in the southern part of the salmons range, wild salmon now face extinction. This is in spite of unprecedented management measures to halt this decline. Arguably the greatest challenge in salmon conservation is to gain insight into the spatial and ecological use of the marine environment by different regional and river stocks, which are known to show variation in marine growth, condition, and survival. Salmon populations may migrate to different marine zones, whose environmental conditions may vary. To date it has been impossible to sample and identify the origin of sufficient numbers of wild salmon at sea to enable this vital question to be addressed. SALSEA-Merge will provide the basis for advancing our understanding of oceanic-scale, ecological and ecosystem processes. Such knowledge is fundamental to the future sustainable management of this key marine species. Through a partnership of 9 European nations the programme will deliver innovation in the areas of: genetic stock identification techniques, new genetic marker development, fine scale estimates of growth on a weekly and monthly basis, the use of novel high seas pelagic trawling technology and individual stock linked estimates of food and feeding patterns. In addition, the use of the three-dimensional Regional Ocean Modelling System, merging hydrography, oceanographic, genetic and ecological data, will deliver novel stock specific migration and distribution models. This widely supported project, provides the basis for a comprehensive investigation into the problems facing salmon at sea. It will also act as an important model for understanding the factors affecting survival of many other important marine species.", null, 4833604.0, "SALSEA-MERGE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.atlanticsalmontrust.org", null, "fp7_87925_998795033"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0RH", "Language Training", "Dunning Primary School", 10487.0, "The participants have been identified as being  very suitable candidates to attend the  French Immersion Course run by LFEE. \r\nThe participants have limited experience in language teaching and it was identified during the Professional Review and Development process that in view of the introduction of the Government's 1+2 Approach to Language learning, new teaching methodologies and resources as well as the importance of cultural education needed to be the emphasis for the future. In addition, the participants feel that with French being the main language introduced in to the primary schools in our Authority, their knowledge of French language and culture would need to be improved in order to help meet the needs of the school in all aspects. The most important aspect being the creation of enthusiastic and motivated learners of all ages. On completion of the Course, the participants will be instrumental in developing the learning and teaching of languages following the Local Authority's strategy for the 1+2 Approach.\r\n\r\nIn time, the participants will lead on developments to ensure links with European countries to further raise awareness and bring to life the cultural dimension of the language learning. This in turn would lead to connections from pupil to pupil and teacher to teacher in each country. This will also help in developing the use of IT as a learning tool for pupils and to realise its importance in making such connections. The participants would also be expected to encourage IT in connecting and exchanging with schools nearer to home, across our cluster. This will further help foster the idea that our children are Europeans as well as Scottish, British or Polish for example.\r\n\r\nThe participants will also be expected to be the language \"champions\" within the school, acting as models of good practice and providing support and guidance both on an individual as well as a school level through in-house and cluster collegiate times for example. The ideas, methodologies and resources provided on the Immersion Course will play a big part in this. Knowledge gained from visiting a French School will also provide topics for discussion both in terms of practice and its education system in general.\r\n\r\nThe participants will also be given the responsibility of co-ordinating the dissemination of information to parents along with the Head Teacher. This will be firstly in the form of a Parents' information evening where the 1+2 Approach will be delivered along with its rationale for their children, both now and for their future. Suggested resources, websites and activities will be made known to them for their own perusal.
