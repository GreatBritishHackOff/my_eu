Particular attention will be paid to factory ramp-up, which is critical for new products and can be a major stumbling block achieving fast time-to-market. We believe that it is only possible to design a virtual manufacturing process by developing a detailed understanding of the system at all levels. COPERNICO is directed at generic issues spanning the interests of all our industrial partners and indeed common to all factories. The problems include optimizing capacity, removing bottlenecks and scheduling (coordinating with both the upstream and downstream supply chain and minimizing work in progress). The emphasis of COPERNICO is on virtual simulation to eliminate problems before they happen. The preplanning stage is an ideal time in the life-cycle of the plant to include human and environmental concerns, safety factors and work-place satisfaction metrics. The objectives are to: 1. Identify and merge the range of mathematical, physical, data driven and knowledge based models with soft data such as worker and environmental considerations to create a tool to predict the behaviour of production processes and overall factory environments. 2. Use the models to develop optimum processing routes 3. Develop novel experimental methodologies to validate the models in a virtual test bed facility 4. Condense the validation and certification time to reduce cost and time 5. Build from machine tools to cells and factories 6. Build on the close working relationship with our industrial collaborators and transfer knowledge 7. Create a modular factory layout system with a diagnostic and solutions toolkit 8.

It is under constant threat from highly automated factories in the east that invest a substantial amount of money in new capital equipment.\n\nFactory models are excellent for optimising products and processes but developing a generic model is no easy task. However, the payoff should be immense for the nearly 99\u00a0% of manufacturing companies considered as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and many larger companies as well.\n\nEU-funded scientists working on the project COPERNICO developed and applied a new classification system to fully describe a manufacturing organisation using only a few characteristics. It is based on the biological concept of cladistics and describes the evolution of companies and the processes, tools and systems employed or abandoned by them.\n\nOnce a company has been classified, it can be compared to a similar one exemplifying best practices whose characteristics are contained in a project-created database. The COPERNICO virtual factory environment is a free online framework that helps the company select the tools required to move to the next level via the Modelling Tools Recommendation Tool. A company can also follow a customised route map to move forward to the next level and adapt to new challenges in production processes or product areas.\n\nEnd-user partners in the consortium applied the tool to real industrial situations at two SMEs, Footprint Sheffield and Temco, and one large company, Electrolux. Results were quite promising. Temco has now moved production of six parts back to Europe from the Far East with decreased costs and improved efficiency. The specialist toolmaker Footprint Sheffield used the tool to redesign its factory and streamline production, gaining 500 productive hours a year to introduce new products. Electrolux has increased throughput and decreased part travel times.\n\nWidespread implementation promises substantial savings in time and money when developing new product procedures and processes, ramping up production quickly without expensive revalidation and certification.
