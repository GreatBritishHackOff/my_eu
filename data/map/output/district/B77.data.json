The result is often a weakening of institutions, an undermined economy and a loss of confidence in the rule of law. This project will undertake research to create and develop secure interoperable situation awareness platform for the EU to combat organised crime and terrorism. The project will use technical (non-personal) ballistics data and crime information initially but will also demonstrate how migration to other data sources can take place. The project will automatically combine data from disparate high volume data repositories for cross correlation and automated (and semi-automated) analysis with data from different cultural/domains with multiple reference models using real-time data feeds and historical databases. Intelligence will be extracted using advanced semantic knowledge extraction and data-mining to facilitate appropriate, fast and responsible decision making and alerts. The platform will develop and demonstrate a trust management and security system, controlled access and an automated reporting tool for cost effective operations as well as providing the policing of existing information systems. The platform will enhance mutual co-operation, security and sustainability across the EU and is supported by EUROPOL, the police and other end users as a being urgently required. The project will develop new EU standards, new Intellectual Property and commercialisation opportunities for the benefit of the EU. The work will involve the use of cutting edge science and technological methods and develop new research agendas for future work.", 346138.0, 3355343.0, "ODYSSEY", null, null, null, "http://odyssey-project.eu/", "http://www.forensic-pathways.com", null, "fp7_89324_998897174"], ["5ES", "Digital Image and Video Forensics", "Forensic Pathways Limited", "This project is about transferring knowledge of image and video forensics between the academia and industry. Building on the complementary expertise of the participants, the consortium aims to pursue two major lines of investigations: Device fingerprint based forensics and hidden data based forensics. The first line of investigation requires the formulation of a set of \u201cfingerprint\u201d left in the images/video by the hardware components or in-built signal processing algorithms of the imaging device and involves the study of its forensic applications. The applications we are aiming for include device identification, technology/licensing infringement detection, device linking, automatic media classification, tampering detection. To guarantee the value of the these techniques, anti-anti-forensics measures will also be devised to detect/prevent removal or substitution of the fingerprint set. The second line of investigation is about the use and analysis of hidden data in the host image/video for authentication, content integrity verification, copyright protection (including ownership identification, proof of ownership, copy control, traitor tracing), and the use and detection of covert communications. Although data hiding is a relatively mature research area, their applicability in the real world is yet to be fully explored due to the fact that the security issues are often interleaved with multimedia processing issues and requires addressing. Therefore this line of research requires the formulation of specific security requirements and attack modelling for specific applications. Overall, both lines of research require a wide variety of expertise such as multimedia signal processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning, and optimisation theory. Therefore it is expected that this project will also take the soundness and applicability of these theories to a new level and lay a solid foundation for wider lasting collaborations in the related areas.", 310638.0, 1313102.0, "DIVEFOR", "Video device fingerprinting", "An EU project examined forensic applications of data fingerprints identifying specific video recorders.

The information can be used forensically in many ways, including matching a particular machine to a certain video.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Digital image and video forensics' (DIVEFOR) project studied the forensic applications of video device fingerprints and of hidden data. The former included device identification and detection of licensing infringement.\n\nResearch addressed measures to prevent removal or alteration of the digital fingerprint. The set of applications based on hidden video data involved authentication, content integrity verification, copyright protection and detection of covert communications. The four-member consortium ran between mid-2010 and mid-2014.\n\nTechnical milestones included formulation of the device fingerprint vector, development of forensic applications, and detection of device fingerprint removal and substitution. The team also developed semi-fragile/fragile digital watermarking, robust digital watermarking, and steganography and steganalysis. The work yielded a total of 24 conference papers and 10 journal papers.\n\nThe project applied for four patents, three of which were pending as of the project's conclusion.\n\nAdditional dissemination work included a set of 4 technical reports, and a series of 20 lectures and demonstrations.\n\nThe DIVEFOR project resulted in development of applications of digital fingerprint analysis technologies for video.

The Flagship is built upon the concept of value chains, one of which is along the axis of materials-components-systems; the ramp-up phase placed substantial resources on the development of materials production technologies, the first core project moved to emphasise components, and the second core project will move further towards integrating components in larger systems.

Assistive technology can provide them with security that will enable them to live independently e.g. wearing alarms and tracking devices around the arm or neck to alert carers to falls or their location if they wander. However such technology is often unsightly and stigmatises the user resulting in high abandonment rates.\nThe MATUROLIFE project will integrate creative artists and fashion designers into the research team to facilitate design-driven innovation. The project will build on existing technological advances in materials which have produced a highly innovative selective metallisation process that utilises nanotechnology, electrochemistry and materials science to encapsulate fibres in textiles with metal and thereby provide conductivity and electronic connectivity. In this way, better integration of electronics and sensors into fabrics and textiles will be possible. This will give the fashion designers and artists the tools to produce AT for older people that is not only functional but is more desirable and appealing as well as being lighter and more comfortable.\nBuilding on exiting best practice the consortium will include societal stakeholder groups representing end users (i.e. older people) who will be heavily involved in the design process as well as giving feedback and direction on the development of AT prototypes contributing significantly to end-user acceptance. The prototypes will demonstrate proof of concept and the industrial scalability of the selective metallisation process will be validated. Thus, the project will end at TRL7.\nThe Assistive Technology produced as a result of the project will benefit all the SMEs in the consortium but particularly those in the creative sector who expect to see sustainable growth and an increase in jobs as a direct result of the project.", 244199.0, 5225365.0, "MATUROLIFE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_212827_911333625"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["5HH", "PRINTED ELECTRONICS LIMITED", 244176.0, "Leadership in nanotechnologies, advanced materials, laser technology, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing (08.02.02.01)", "fts_2017_7264", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "B77"}
