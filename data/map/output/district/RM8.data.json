Hence, the safetalkers debate is a unique platform that will cut across social and cultural barriers, as an informal European class of students that would go back to their schools and jointly head the debaters club.\r\n\r\nNumber and Profiles of Participants:\r\nOur participants will be students between the ages of 14 and 30 and their teachers from UK, Germany, France and Norway. And will be engaging in a Debate project taking place at the University of East London. The project will run for 6 days in a month for a duration of 9 months. During which time they will have the opportunity to bond with fellow participants and gain knowledge of the cultures and a carefully crafted London tour.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nMentoring sessions are organized for the students when they arrive the United Kingdom. Here, the theories and grammar will be gone over one final time by our hand picked English University students. Various teaching methods will be used during this time including:\r\nRole play\r\nBreathing techniques\r\nConfidence building activities.\r\nTeam building activities.\r\nAll of the above will happen bearing in mind that the students would have had a proper knowledge of the topics before arriving in the United kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe results and Impacts envisaged:\r\nJust some of the benefits our participants can expect to achieve during this project are;\r\n- An increased motivation on discussing social issues\r\n- Increased knowledge of internationalization strategies\r\n- Enhanced intellectual awareness\r\n- Improved English language skills \r\n- Expanded self empowerment/self esteem\r\n- The participants are encouraged and empowered by the mentors to go back and jointly head their debate clubs.\r\n\r\nPotential longer termed benefits:\r\nThe Debate itself will be recorded by an accomplished media company and televised on satellite channel \"Information Television\" in a series of programs named \"The Safe Talk\". All debates will also be available to view on our sister website www.signaturekids.co.uk.\r\n\r\n\"The Safe Talk\" will show participants in 2 groups debating over a specific topic. A moderator will be present to ensure its smooth running and each debate will also contain a main guest which will be an expert in the topic field to maximize the benefit participants and viewers receive from the discussion.\r\n\r\nTelevising the Debate means making it readily available to the millions of viewers that \"Information Television\" has. This ensures its impact on society and therefore achieves our goal of giving these students a voice. We strongly believe that once up and running this project will grow from strength to strength.", "http://www.oandmpartnership.org", "Tendercubs - O&M Partnership", "erasmus_2014-3-UK01-KA105-012157_coordinator"], ["2EQ", "Business Education in Europe", "Tendercubs - O&M Partnership", 21305.0, "Due to globalisation vocational training programs require more and more international orientation. This applies especially to our trainees who are studying to work with foreign languages and are thus prepared for an occupation abroad or in relation to partners from different countries. To make sure that theoretical knowledge can be transferred to practical tasks and in order to create a close relation between the working world and vocational training programs, we integrate an eight-week period of work placement into our programs. It is particularly meaningful to carry out these work placements in other European countries, since markets are growing together and career opportunities improve on a joint European labour market.We scheduled the work placement period between the first and second year of our students\u2019 vocational training. On the one hand this means that they already gained a lot of knowledge relevant to their occupation and the language of their host country and on the other hand trainees get a valuable orientation concerning their career entry. In addition a work placement in a foreign country strengthens young people\u2019s social skills such as intercultural competence and self-confidence which are necessary for a successful and content professional and private life.In 2016 and 2017 alltogether 20 students will do an eight week internship in a company in England, France or Spain and thus explore the european labour market.", "http://www.oandmpartnership.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-003104_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "RM8"}
