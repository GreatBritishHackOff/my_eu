The lack of uniform requirements for defining, detecting and recording suicidality and the presence of disease related confounders create major problems. It is possible that Medication-Related Suicidality (MRS) differs from Psychopathology-Related Suicidality (PRS) in terms of phenomenology, clinical expression and time course, and may vary between children and adults. Unlike PRS, the time-course of MRS may be associated with possible differences in drug pharmacokinetics; abrupt onset; absence of suicidality prior to start of medication; and emergence of suicidality related co-morbidities after treatment.\nThis proposal will focus on developing a web-based comprehensive methodology for the assessment and monitoring of suicidality and its mediators in children and adolescents using the HealthTrackerTM (a paediatric web-based health outcome monitoring system), with the aim of developing a Suicidality Assessment and Monitoring Module, a Bio-psycho-social Mediators of Suicidality Assessment Module, and a Suicidality-Related Psychiatric and Physical Illness Module. The information obtained will be used to computer-generate classification of suicidality using the Classification of Suicide-Related Thoughts and Behaviour (Silverman et al, 2007) and the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicidal Assessment (C-CASA) (Posner et al, 2007). The existing Medication Characteristics Module will be expanded to allow documentation of pharmacological characteristics of medication, to explore whether they mediate MRS. The methodology will then be tested in 3 paediatric observational trials (risperidone in conduct disorder; fluoxetine in depression, and montelukast in bronchial asthma) and standardized, which can be used pharmacovigilance and in epidemiological, observational, and registration trials.", 119168.0, 3110783.0, "STOP", "Title: Finding the link between drugs and suicidal thinking", "Detecting suicidal tendencies in children and adolescents on medications can be challenging. Researchers are testing a web-based tool to identify those at risk.", "Through the'Suicidality: Treatment occurring in paediatrics' (STOP) project, an assessment and monitoring tool has been developed. It will be tested with three groups of children and adolescents. \n\nThe first group consists of 400 children and adolescents on antipsychotic medication. The second group is made up 240 patients taking antidepressants. The third group of 200 is on asthma medication. The effectiveness of this tool will be compared to the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicidal Assessment (C-CASA), considered the gold standard. \n\nAs part of the STOP study, researchers designed a methodology for detecting signals of suicide-related adverse events (SRAEs) related to medications. The methodology was developed based on data from previously conducted large-scale studies.This tool has great potential.\nIt can be used when children and adolescents start taking a new medication. If certain side effects are correlated with suicidal tendencies, it may be possible to be on the lookout for those indications. The tool also can be used to monitor suicidal tendencies in routine clinical care.    \n\nThere is the possibility that the final web-based system can be modified for hand-held computers such as IPads, as well as for mobile phones.\nSuch innovations will make the tool even more user-friendly.\n\nThe tool has already contributed to the field. Recommendations on how to report serious side effects have been published in the literature. The team will also be able to help in the collection of biological data from other studies. As a result, the causes of suicidal tendencies may be better understood.\n\nOver time, findings from STOP research may allow clinicians to identify high-risk groups. Then prophylactic interventions can be used in multiple settings, saving lives.", null, "http://www.trueclarity.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112455.jpg", "fp7_97369_992162076"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BS30"}
