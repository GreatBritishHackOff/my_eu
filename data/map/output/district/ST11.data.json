The main idea of the proposal is the effective dispersion and the controllable size of the metal nanoparticles into the substrate that will lead to improved performance. To this end a modified polyol process as well as chemical and physical treatment of selected substances will enable the introduction of transition metal nanoparticles on the catalyst substrate precursors via adsorption and ion-exchange. The presence of metal ions sorbed on fixed precursor sites will inhibit the agglomeration during heating and final products with very fine particle dispersion and tuneable metal content will be obtained. It is expected that the developed catalysts will exhibit increased catalytic performance, even at low temperatures (200-250oC). Other key properties of the proposed nanostructured catalysts include: increased thermal stability (avoiding aggregation), improved durability, capability of reuse and recovery of transition metals as well as low health and environmental impact.\nApart from the scientific innovations and the environmental impact, the proposal holds also great economic importance. Taking into account that the autocatalyst industry uses extremely large quantities of precious metal-68% of Pt and 72% of Pd in Europe \u2013 the impact of replacing PGMs is of tremendous significance. Based on the current metal prices, it is estimated that the developed catalysts will reduce the catalyst cost at about 40-50%, opening the way to an efficient adaptation of nanotechnology-based catalysts in the automotive sector.", 243491.0, 4474065.0, "NEXT-GEN-CAT", "Replacing noble metals in catalytic converters", "Novel nanoscale technology is set to slash the costs of cleaning up automobile emissions and enable the secure flow of critical raw materials providing a major boost to EU companies in the automotive sector.", "Catalytic converters are now key components of most automotive exhaust systems contributing to major reductions in emissions. They catalyse reactions that convert pollutants into harmless or less harmful substances. Three-way catalysts are state of the art. They simultaneously oxidise carbon monoxide and organic molecules and reduce nitrogen oxides to yield carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen.\n\nMost commonly, converters consist of a ceramic substrate coated with a precious metal-containing washcoat. A combination of platinum group metals (PGMs) including platinum, palladium and rhodium is often used. Currently, the European automotive industry uses huge quantities of these precious metals, imposing large costs and depleting natural resources. Scientists are working on low-cost, eco-friendly alternatives with EU-funding of the project 'Development of next generation cost efficient automotive catalysts' (http://www.nextgencat.eu/ (NEXT-GEN-CAT)).\n\nThe focus is on the use of nanoparticles (NPs) of transition metals such as copper, nickel, iron and manganese for partial or complete replacement of PGMs. Effective exploitation and enhanced performance require excellent dispersion and control of NP size on the substrate.\n\nResearchers employed several eco-friendly preparation processes that minimise the environmental and health impact compared to manufacture of traditional catalysts. Twenty-two samples were extensively characterised. Results were quite promising, demonstrating excellent dispersion, tuneable NP size, thermal stability and durability.\n\nScientists also applied a variety of characterisation techniques to ceramic thin films, catalyst support materials. Data will be used to develop a nanoscale model of the materials and processes. The catalytic performance of selected materials was also tested pointing the way to further optimisation in upcoming months. Finally, the team has begun evaluation of end-of-life scenarios for regeneration of the catalyst via deactivation and recovery of transition metals. Life cycle assessments were performed.\n\nPartial or complete replacement of PGMs with transition metal NPs in three-way catalysts is expected to decrease costs by around 40 to 50 %. It would also enhance sustainability and ensure a reliable raw materials supply to EU manufacturers. This eco-friendly and cost-effective technology should be attractive to drivers as well.", "http://www.nextgencat.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2014/148157.jpg", "fp7_102135_961692436"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["9AU", "Staffordshire Business Innovation & Incubation Support 3 (SBIIS3)", "Staffordshire & Black Country Business Innovation Centre Ltd", "CONTINUATION AND EXPANSION OF EXISTING SUCCESSFUL SBIS2 ERDF PROJECT\nThe key aims of the project are to:\n1.
