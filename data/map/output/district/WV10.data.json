The volume of leachate produced is increased by rainfall. It cannot be directly discharged to water courses as it contains many hazardous pollutants and therefore must be retained for treatment. This proposal contains details of the approach we will take to develop an automated, modular, mobile leachate treatment system. The treatment will be carried out directly in an advanced oxidation process that uses reactions at both the anode and the cathode of a new form of electrolytic cell that we will develop. Whilst current treatment methods can be expensive to install and maintain, may involve the use of chemicals and require permanent positioning at the landfill site, our apparatus will allow new treatment strategies to be used by the landfill operators. The automated, mobile system will offer a flexibility of operation that is not currently available. Cost savings will be made due to the reduced treatment time of our system, using reactions at the anode and cathode rather than the anode only. Additional savings can be made by the use of renewable energy to power the process. Electricity is the only resource required, hence wind or photovoltaic generation of power would allow operating costs to be minimised. With over 150,000 landfill sites across Europe, and an estimated annual spend of \u20ac 10-17 billion on leachate treatment, there is already a large market available. It is expected that leachate treatment will become a bigger industry as environmental Directives, aimed at improving the quality of EU water, are implemented. Landfill leachate producers will not be the only waste stream producers that could benefit from our apparatus.

BioEcoSIM will valorise livestock manure as an important example of valuable bio-waste into 1) pathogen-free, P-rich organic soil amendment (P-rich biochar), 2) slow releasing mineral fertilisers and 3) reclaimed water. By doing this, we will i) reduce negative environmental impacts (eutrophication of water bodies, and NH3 and N2O emissions) in intensive livestock regions, ii) help to decrease NH3 produced by the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process, (iii) mitigate EU\u2019s dependency on the depleting mineral sources for P-fertilisers, (iv) increase water efficiency use in agriculture and (v) support European Strategies and Directives, while generating economic benefits in the agriculture and bio-economy sector.\n\nThe project will combine three innovative technologies 1) superheated steam drying and non-catalytic pyrolysis to convert carbon in manure into P-rich biochar and syngas, 2) electrolytic precipitation of struvite and calcium phosphate and 3) selective separation and recovery of NH3 by gas-permeable membrane. Energy required in-process will be generated through combustion of syngas, thus reducing the pressure on finite fossil fuel.

Finally, they also recovered ammonia from the liquid using gas permeable membranes.\n\nThey have now built lab-scale units that integrate all three technologies, with the resulting products being biochar, gas, phosphorus, ammonia and reclaimed water. In this resource-efficient process, the gas will be used to help power the system while the water will be recycled for livestock or irrigation.\n\nBIOECOSIM's technology should reduce the amount of environmentally toxic surplus nutrients entering water systems in regions with high livestock intensities.

Its main aim is to reduce the progressive skills mismatch registered within the local sector of the industry 4.0. Beginning from a mobility action , the project aims at achieving important specific objectives, such as: \r\n1. promoting a better matching between education and professional training;\r\n2. encouraging local youth employability and spreading the right competencies required from the industry 4.0;\r\n3. experimenting a learning methodology based on work (WBL);\r\n4. supporting knowledge acquisition along with technical-professional competencies and transversal skills in the reference sector; \r\n5.

The ideal candidates would come from Vocational Institutes where they studied informatics, telecommunications, mechanics and ,mechatronics, electrics/ electronics and/or other types of high schools which might have held similar training paths.  The project will give them the opportunity to carry out a professional internship of 180 days (6 months) in foreign companies related to the abovementioned economic sectors and in the following countries: United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Malta and Netherlands, which are pioneering countries in the project main sectors, protagonist of the transformation process above described. \r\nIn order to achieve the previously defined purposes, Glocal, in quality of coordinator, built a national Consortium made up of those main social stakeholders that play an important role within the interconnection process between education and productive system: Regione Campania, Ufficio Scolastico Regionale (USR) together with 10 vocational institues, Federmanager, Confindustria campania, trade unions organizations such as CGIL, CISL E UIL, Fondazione Carisal, in cooperation with foreign receiving organizations and host companies operating  in the industry 4.0.  For its duration, T.R.E.N.D. may produce an important impact at many levels: local, regional and national at the same time, due to the connection between public/private bodies from education and professional training and the representatives of the labour market. They would be connected in a profitable exchange of ideas and best practices, in a debate on possible modalities and promotion strategies as regards the theme of youth employability. After their mobility abroad, the project\u2019s participants will be given a new opportunity of internship at some Italian companies, which already showed availability in hosting the candidates that acquired the most specific skills during their experience abroad. \r\nThe entire local Campania territory will benefit from the growth of its human resources\u2019 abilities and skills. These young resources will be open-minded towards a more European perspective, but at the same time they will contribute to the competitiveness of the local productive system and will feed the innovation power that lies within their territory.

staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the organizations involved, to learn to operate internationally, to understand how to provide the most stimulating educational activities, to create a modern and dynamic working environment, to develop activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for

employability;\r\n- Peers of the students are indirect beneficiaries, through the experiences of the participants in the action.\r\n\r\nTeachers:\r\n- The renewed interest in teaching will bring greater efficiency in learning of the students;\r\n- Sharing a common experience with the students will produce a greater understanding of their difficulties and more effective communication between teachers and students;\r\n- A better understanding of the labor market in Europe will offer more precise knowledge in supporting the education of students.\r\n\r\nSchools:\r\n- Increased ability to

The programme will be aimed at improving the competencies of the staff in managing and coordinating VET mobilities, and in enhancing the value of transnational mobility as a training tool.  \r\nThe whole PLUS-MUSE project will be accompanied by promotion, monitoring, evaluation and dissemination actions, to take place at the start, during and at the end of the project.", "http://WWW.geckoprogrammes.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005770_3"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["0EN", "R1A", "NEW CROSS HOSPITAL"], ["0QP", "RL4", "HOSPITAL LIASON 1"], ["0QP", "RL4", "HOSPITAL LIASON 2"], ["0QP", "RL4", "NEW CROSS HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WV10"}
