The volume of leachate produced is increased by rainfall. It cannot be directly discharged to water courses as it contains many hazardous pollutants and therefore must be retained for treatment. This proposal contains details of the approach we will take to develop an automated, modular, mobile leachate treatment system. The treatment will be carried out directly in an advanced oxidation process that uses reactions at both the anode and the cathode of a new form of electrolytic cell that we will develop. Whilst current treatment methods can be expensive to install and maintain, may involve the use of chemicals and require permanent positioning at the landfill site, our apparatus will allow new treatment strategies to be used by the landfill operators. The automated, mobile system will offer a flexibility of operation that is not currently available. Cost savings will be made due to the reduced treatment time of our system, using reactions at the anode and cathode rather than the anode only. Additional savings can be made by the use of renewable energy to power the process. Electricity is the only resource required, hence wind or photovoltaic generation of power would allow operating costs to be minimised. With over 150,000 landfill sites across Europe, and an estimated annual spend of \u20ac 10-17 billion on leachate treatment, there is already a large market available. It is expected that leachate treatment will become a bigger industry as environmental Directives, aimed at improving the quality of EU water, are implemented. Landfill leachate producers will not be the only waste stream producers that could benefit from our apparatus. Other industries such as food production, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals will also be able to see financial and environmental benefits of treating their waste streams using technology developed in the CleanLeachate project", 175950.0, 989721.0, "CLEANLEACHATE", null, null, null, "http://www.cleanleachate.eu", "http://www.enitial.co.uk", null, "fp7_97072_985344334"], ["7DE", "An innovative bio-economy solution to valorise livestock manure into a range of stabilised soil improving materials for environmental sustainability and economic benefit for European agriculture", "Initial Projects Limited", "BioEcoSIM comprises R&D and demonstration of an integrated approach and business model that has wide EU27 applicability in the agriculture sector. The new European Bio-economy Strategy aims to increase the use of bio-based raw materials. Thus, large quantities of fertilisers will be required. Therefore, this project targets to produce sustainable soil improving products that can be easily handled, transported, and applied. BioEcoSIM will valorise livestock manure as an important example of valuable bio-waste into 1) pathogen-free, P-rich organic soil amendment (P-rich biochar), 2) slow releasing mineral fertilisers and 3) reclaimed water. By doing this, we will i) reduce negative environmental impacts (eutrophication of water bodies, and NH3 and N2O emissions) in intensive livestock regions, ii) help to decrease NH3 produced by the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process, (iii) mitigate EU\u2019s dependency on the depleting mineral sources for P-fertilisers, (iv) increase water efficiency use in agriculture and (v) support European Strategies and Directives, while generating economic benefits in the agriculture and bio-economy sector.\n\nThe project will combine three innovative technologies 1) superheated steam drying and non-catalytic pyrolysis to convert carbon in manure into P-rich biochar and syngas, 2) electrolytic precipitation of struvite and calcium phosphate and 3) selective separation and recovery of NH3 by gas-permeable membrane. Energy required in-process will be generated through combustion of syngas, thus reducing the pressure on finite fossil fuel. Water reclaimed from manure will be utilised for livestock production and/or irrigation. The sustainability of this approach will be validated against standards ISO14040 and ISO14044.

Despite this, farmers often get rid of surplus manure waste, consuming energy for treatment and transport and generating air pollution.\n\nThe EU-funded project http://www.bioecosim.eu/ (BIOECOSIM) (An innovative bio-economy solution to valorise livestock manure into a range of stabilised soil improving materials for environmental sustainability and economic benefit for European agriculture) has developed three innovative technologies to turn manure into mineral nutrients, gas and water.\n\nFirst, researchers heated the manure to extremely high temperatures in an oxygen-free environment to produce gas, liquid and a carbon-rich solid residue called biochar. To do this, they developed a thermal processing unit that can take up to 100\u00a0kg/h of raw pig manure.\n\nAfter removing the solid biochar, researchers precipitated a mineral phosphate fertiliser mixture from the remaining liquid. Finally, they also recovered ammonia from the liquid using gas permeable membranes.\n\nThey have now built lab-scale units that integrate all three technologies, with the resulting products being biochar, gas, phosphorus, ammonia and reclaimed water. In this resource-efficient process, the gas will be used to help power the system while the water will be recycled for livestock or irrigation.\n\nBIOECOSIM's technology should reduce the amount of environmentally toxic surplus nutrients entering water systems in regions with high livestock intensities. It may also generate income for farmers who could sell the project's soil-improving products and generate electricity from the gas.", null, "http://www.enitial.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-10/163629.jpg", "fp7_105527_985344334"], ["6QJ", "Tilt Rotor Heat Exchanger", "Hs Marston Aerospace Limited", "The overall objective of the project is to design, develop; manufacture and flight qualify a novel heat exchanger for oil cooling in the transmission system of a civil Tilt Rotor aircraft.
