It will model, identify, and verify phemes (internet memes with added truthfulness or deception), as they spread across media, languages, and social networks.<br/>PHEME will achieve this by developing novel cross-disciplinary social semantic methods, combining document semantics, a priori large-scale world knowledge (e.g. Linked Open Data) and a posteriori knowledge and context from social networks, cross-media links and spatio-temporal metadata.

The current major sources of PUFAs (fish, algae and fish oil products) are threatened by global warming, pollution and overfishing, therefore novel and sustainable sources are sought after. PUFAs are biosynthesised de novo in bacteria by multifunctional iterative enzymes, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (Pfa) synthases.

Speroni, who for a time taught logic and philosophy at the University of Padua, maintained that philosophy should not be limited to Latin (the language of learned culture), but could just as easily be discussed in the language of the people. As the prince of the Academy of the Infiammati in Padua (1541), he required that lectures be delivered exclusively in Italian and exercised considerable influence on Alessandro Piccolomini and Torquato Tasso (among the most important figures in sixteenth-century Italian culture). His writings, particularly the Dialogo delle lingue, were also highly influential in France, including on Joachim Du Bellay\u2019s Deffence et illustration de la langue fran\u00e7oise (1549)\u2014that seminal work of French classicism\u2014and on Claude Gruget, who translated the Dialogo into French (1551). Speroni symbolizes a new, evolving kind of literary figure: in his case, one who went from university professor to academy member to courtier in his later years. At the same time, his anti-humanistic programme proposed an attempt to mediate between high culture and consumer culture. Furthermore, Speroni acted as a model for professionalization and specialization within the field of literature, and particularly vernacular literature.

Under very strong rare earthquakes, conventional structures may be also vulnerable to collapse (life safety issue). In addition, past earthquakes showed significant damage in non-structural elements (walls, storage racks, acceleration-sensitive medical equipment, etc) due to large storey drifts and total floor accelerations. The aforementioned socio-economic risks highlight the need for minimal-damage structures with increased collapse resistance and the inherent potential to reduce structural and non-structural damage. The ambitious main objective of the proposal is the development of a novel minimal-damage steel frame that has the potential to: (a) address all the disadvantages of previously developed seismic-resistant steel frames; (b) experience minimal damage that can be rapidly repaired, and so, offer immediate return to building use or occupation after strong earthquakes; and (c) eliminate the probability of collapse (i.e., protection of human life) under very strong rare earthquakes. The project will develop fundamental knowledge, design details and criteria, and performance-based seismic design methods for the proposed novel steel frame by conducting state-of-the-art integrated experimental and analytical research.

Two desingularization procedures are carried out (including a time renormalization) to obtain an evolution equation (the binormal equation). While an isolated vortex line does not fit any known concept of solution (given the singularity of the velocity), and there has been significant recent activity on the nonuniqueness of solutions of Euler (De Lellis & Szekelyhidi, and recently Isett) it is expected that the geometric assumptions made about the solution will still make it possible to find a suitable concept of solution.

For example, some microorganisms can only grow in groups with other species, and many use chemicals called signalling compounds to communicate with each other.\n\nThe team increased cultivation efficiency by accurately mimicking natural environmental parameters, including co-cultivating microorganisms in defined species groups and using signalling molecules for cell-to-cell communication. Researchers also investigated these microorganisms' genetic information for potentially useful biological compounds in order to prioritise the most interesting strains.\n\nMACUMBA is also developing automated, high-throughput instruments in order to scale-up its new techniques for industrial applications.

Within the chemicals sector polymer production plays a significant role, with European market share of 25% and providing employment to 1.6 million people within EU27.\nMany polymer products are manufactured using batch and semi-batch reactors. In most cases the process parameters, such as temperature profile, feeds, etc follow a specific time schedule, which has been fixed after an expensive period of product and process development. This tight recipe schedule is sensitive against disturbances e.g., unexpected variation in operating conditions, variation in feed purity etc., which inevitably leads to variations in polymer structure and\u00a0to inter-batch variability and off-spec products. Furthermore, the use of empirically determined recipes with fixed-time controls does not allow intensification of the process which requires time-varying feeds and reactor temperature to run the reaction faster and hence closer to its limits,  and also to switching from a semi-batch to other reactor or process types.\nCOOPOL addresses the complex issues of real-time process control based on advanced models and on-line sensors, to develop a generic basis for widely applicable sustainable intensified processes. COOPOL will develop a new process control approach, linking molecular level information and understanding of the reaction chemistry with real-time sensing, rigorous modeling based on first principles, subsequent model reduction and non-linear model-predictive control (NMPC) with economic objectives, called dynamic real-time optimisation (DRTO).

It seems likely that if we were able to teach plastics or other polymers how to template new copies of themselves that we would similarly be able to make new, impossible materials and hence further expand the potential function and properties of these materials. These new materials would provide enhanced properties and function (such as replication and evolution) that are not currently available to material chemists.

Several techniques such as immunofluorescence double labelling, confocal laser scanning microscopy and peptidomics helped understand PREP function and interaction with other proteins and cytoskeletal components.\n\nResearchers demonstrated that modifying PREP levels to prevent learning and memory losses will not work as several key processes are compromised in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. PREPs were linked with intracrine and endocrine processes, intracellular processes like signalling and secretion, as well as with extracellular processes like neural plasticity. Structural analysis of PREP, PREP inhibition and peptidomics provided novel drugs for ND therapy by PREP inhibition using Z-Pro-Prolinal (ZPP) or KYP-2047.\n\nCellular models revealed that PREP is critical in processing amyloid precursor protein (APP). AD could be caused due to dysfunctional APP metabolism or clearance as well as abnormal changes in PREP interaction with tau proteins.\n\nPREPs modified alpha-synuclein aggregation patterns that cause plaque deposition associated with neuro-degeneration. This was demonstrated clearly in animal and cellular models of PD and administering PREP inhibitors substantially reduced alpha-synuclein plaque density. Results were supported by PREP and alpha-synuclein co-localisation seen in actual PD brains.\n\nA novel peptide chip technology for peptide microarray analysis was validated for diagnostic and clinical research applications.

The study included research with both qualitative and quantitative evaluation, which has demonstrated the positive benefits of advanced training for NPCs for the future of healthcare in SSA.\n\nETATMBA's leadership element distinguishes it from other initiatives: leadership training has helped to build capacity and improve services and proved central to the project's delivery in both countries.  The content and teaching materials of the BSc modules are freely available to trainers in low-income countries and can be accessed http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/about/global/etatmba/training/malawi/ (online).\n\nNational guidelines were reviewed in close collaboration with authorities in the Ministry of Health in Malawi and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in Tanzania.

The importance of best practice through implementation was an essential aspect of NPCs\u2019 training, tailored according to each country\u2019s needs and capacities.\n\nETATMBA has contributed to improving maternal and neonatal health care in SSA through training, enhancing clinical guidelines and engaging stakeholders and regulatory authorities.

Nevertheless, the probabilistic approach is appropriate since specific trajectories are unpredictable in \u201cchaotic\u201d systems.  At the other extreme, stochastic systems evolve in a random manner by assumption.\n\nOne of the main topics of this proposal is to investigate how separation of time scales can cause a fast-slow deterministic system to converge to a stochastic differential equation (SDE).   This is called homogenization; the fast variables are averaged out and the limiting SDE is generally of much lower dimension than the original system.   The focus is mainly on situations where the SDE limit is driven by Brownian motion, but SDEs driven by stable L\u00e9vy processes are also of interest.   Homogenization is reasonably well-understood when the underlying fast-slow system is itself stochastic.  However there are very few results for deterministic fast-slow systems.   The aim is to make homogenization rigorous in a very general setting, and as a byproduct to determine how the stochastic integrals in the SDE are to be interpreted.\n\nA second main topic is to explore the idea that anomalous diffusion in the form of a superdiffusive L\u00e9vy process arises naturally in odd dimensions but not in even dimensions.   The context is pattern formation in spatially extended systems with Euclidean symmetry, and this dichotomy can be seen as an extension of the classical Huygens principle that sound waves propagate in odd but not even dimensions.  For anisotropic systems (where there are translation symmetries only), the situation is simpler: chaotic dynamics leads to Brownian motion and weakly chaotic dynamics (of intermittent type) leads to a L\u00e9vy process.

Thirty partners from 11 EU countries joined forces to find reserves, exploit raw materials and mining waste and create new markets for nanomaterial-based products.\n\nScientists created the first pan-European Georesource database including the primary raw materials and secondary raw materials of anthropogenic origin. In addition, PROMINE produced the only map of Critical Raw Materials in Europe.. The EC used these to support research and technological development as well as provide the framework for smart and sustainable growth of enterprises and industry. Researchers also created a four-dimensional model predicting the time evolution of four mineralised belts in Europe, enabling the mining industry to accurately assess new ore deposits. The results are very promising and PROMINE showed that Europe is still strongly underexplored and there are lots of ore deposits in Europe to be found, especially in the deeper bedrock layers.\n\nEfforts to capitalise on mining waste were amazingly successful. Treating Greek mining waste with industrial acids yielded extremely pure nano-silica with industrial applicability as an additive e.g. for construction materials and paper products. Commercialisation is under way. Similar commercial potential was found with rhenium-alloys extracted from residuals of the processing of copper ores.  Rhenium is essential to special materials used in jet engines. Nano-powdered schwertmanite recovered from lignite mining waste streams was used as a pigment in paints and as a water decontaminant.\n\nResearchers have also developed several technologies for preparing secondary mineral resources for metal extraction and recovery. Reliability of new technologies, including biotechnology, for an ecoefficient production of strategic metals was demonstrated. Investigators are pursuing patents for the most promising results. \n\nA life cycle assessment highlighted the numerous advantages of PROMINE products over commercial competitors.

It assessed security concepts, aiming to bridge the gap between security theory and governance in an EU context.\n\nOne central objective was to build a comparative and sophisticated methodology that transcends the traditional notion of security. Another was to map bilateral, regional and global cooperation that the EU is involved in.

The topics involved regional conflict, terrorism, WMD proliferation, energy security in light of climate change, severe human rights violations and migration.\n\nAlso noteworthy was the foresight exercise that identified key variables likely to affect future multilateral security governance. This included a workshop to identify probable future scenarios, and a workshop for EU policymakers to outline security and policy implications for each scenario.\n\nAn interesting and very relevant finding regarding security was the role of social media in political instability, such as during the Arab Spring.

In the vast literature focusing on the international or transnational dimensions of community conflicts, little attention has been given so far to the role played by transnational peace movements. It seems that we still lack a comprehensive analysis of the involvement of transnational peace movement in community conflicts, especially in two directions: how are they affected by larger processes such as globalisation while contributing to shaping them? What are the local effects of their actions, both in areas affected by the conflict and in the country where they mobilize? This is especially true of peace movements which conjugate their political involvement for peace with a community orientation and membership, namely which appear to be connected to one \u201cside\u201d of the conflict. Not only does their action impact on the conflict, especially by acting directly in the territories where it takes place, these community peace movements also strive to change representations regarding it in the mobilizing country.

Such methods are usually called rounding algorithms since they usually transform a fractional solution into an integral one.\n\nBy designing new randomized rounding methods overcoming the  drawbacks of existing methods our capability to solve and analyze optimization problems would increase dramatically both from the viewpoint of understanding the underlying mathematical structure of the problems and practical solving of real-life optimization problems, especially problems that require complicated linear programming relaxations, e.g. transportation, routing, bin packing problems.'", 79594.0, 79594.0, "RRADOMP", null, null, null, null, "http://www.warwick.ac.uk", null, "fp7_104339_999976784"], ["8UW", "Seismology of flaring coronal loops", "The University of Warwick", "Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and oscillations, observed in astrophysical, laboratory and space plasmas provide us with an excellent tool for the remote diagnostics of the plasmas, which are, in particular, implemented in the techniques of solar coronal seismology, Earth\u2019s magnetospheric magnetoseismology, and MHD spectroscopy of tokamaks.

Unfortunately their proof is based on tricky calculations and lacks conceptuality. On the other hand, Mori theory has emerged since the 1980s as the right framework to study birational maps in higher dimension, of which automorphisms of C\u00b3 are special cases. However up to now the known factorization algorithm (&quot;Sarkisov program&quot;) has been essentially applied to varieties with a small group of birational selfmaps (typically a smooth 3-dimensional quartic, where one thus obtains an irrationality criterion). Very recently, Hacon and McKernan had made an announcement that the Sarkisov program in any dimension follows as a corollary from their major breakthrough; however their result is still very theoretical.

It must consist of a lucid questioning of the present and the deliberate undertaking, on the part of the philosopher, to accomplish a task in the current time. Thus, Foucault makes consistent theoretical sense of all of his earlier historical inquiries and of his genealogical and archaeological method. These had, in fact, shed light on the historical conditions for the emergence of the current configurations of knowledge and power and the modes of subjectivation. From this point of view, then, they constitute a questioning of our present.

He must indicate those points whereby a change of the current configurations of knowledge, power, and the modes of subjectivation, becomes possible.

Considering that the building stock constitutes the largest single energy consumer in the EU, and that the value of the European mortgage market is equal to 53% of EU\u2019s GDP, there is huge potential to bridge financial innovation and the EE world and to unlock the benefits of mortgage financing to support EE to the benefit of all.\nThe EeMAP Project intends to deliver a standardised framework based on a market benchmark to stimulate EE investment by households in the EU\u2019s housing stock by way of a private banking financing mechanism.\nThree key outputs will be: a framework for a building energy passport, recording the EE history of a property by recognising the improvements made; a framework that can integrate the \u201cgreen value\u201d of a property through EE and collected market data; the framework for an EE mortgage product. Accordingly, EE investment will become financially viable, as market transparency will be improved. The Project will create synergies in the mortgage and covered bond value chain, delivering a virtuous circle between lenders, borrowers and investors from the origination of the energy efficient mortgage to the pooling of EE collateral for the purpose of energy efficient covered bonds.

First, the criterion for normative analysis is opportunity, not preference satisfaction.

Second, using a new version of the theory of \u2018team reasoning\u2019, the relationship between parties to a market transaction can be construed in terms of a joint intention to achieve mutual benefit.

One prominent example is the Z(4430)\\ particle, which was discovered in 2008 by the Belle experiment and was recently confirmed by LHCb. Its nature sparked a lot of interest in the theory community because it is charged and decays to charmonium.

We propose to perform spectroscopy studies using the Lambda(b) to J/psi p K and Lambda(b) to psi(2S) p K decays of Lambda(b) baryons.

Ice crystal growth is a major problem in settings as diverse as oil fields, wind turbines, road surfaces and frozen food. Analysis of the process of cryopreservation, whereby donor cells are frozen for later use, has revealed that ice recrystallization is a major contributor to cell death upon thawing. Enhanced cryopreservation methods are particularly needed for stem cell storage to maximize the use of this currently limited resource, but also to enable storage of clinically transfused cells such as platelets and red blood cells. AFGPs have thus far not found application in cryopreservation due to their low availability from natural sources, extremely challenging synthesis, indications of cytotoxicity, but more importantly they have a side effect of shaping ice crystals into needle-shapes which pierces cells\u2019 membranes, killing them.

PKSs could be developed for industry to produce chemically difficult to synthesize drugs, but cannot be harnessed until we understand how they work on the molecular level. However, such understanding is missing because we cannot easily investigate large complexes with current structural biology and modeling methods. A key puzzle is how the function of these multicomponent systems emerges from atomic-scale interactions of their parts. Solving this puzzle requires a holistic approach involving measuring and modeling the relevant interacting parts together. \nOur goal is to develop a multidisciplinary approach rooted in solid and solution state NMR that will make possible studies of complexes from PKSs. The two main challenges for the NMR of PKSs are increasing sensitivity and resolution. Recent innovations from our lab allow application of solid-state to study large complexes in 2\u201310 nanomole quantities. Building on this approach, with a protein-antibody complex as a test case, we will develop new NMR methods that will enable a study of structure and motions of domains in complexes. We will probe, for the first time, the structural dynamics of PKSs of enacyloxin and gladiolin, which are antibiotics against life-threatening multidrug resistant hospital-acquired Acinetobacter baumannii infections and tuberculosis. These studies will guide rational engineering of the PKSs to enable synthetic biology approaches to produce new antibiotics. \nIf successful, this project will go beyond the state of the art by: enabling studies of unknown proteins in large complexes and providing unique insights into novel mechanisms for controlling biosynthesis in PKSs, turning them into truly programmable synthetic biology devices.", 1678204.0, 1678204.0, "complexNMR", null, null, null, null, "http://www.warwick.ac.uk", null, "h2020_193680_999976784"], ["8UW", "Random Graph Geometry and Convergence", "The University of Warwick", "We propose an intradisciplinary research programme in pure mathematics, with graph theory at the epicenter and rich connections to other fields.\n\nAlthough the bonds between graph theory and other branches of mathematics have been growing in recent years, large parts of graph theory are still almost isolated from the rest of mathematics, and conversely, there are fields based on graphs that still make hardly any use of graph-theoretic machinery: the study of Cayley graphs in combinatorial group theory, the recent notion of Benjamini\u2013 Schramm convergence, and the many instances of approximating continuous spaces by graphs in various contexts are such examples.\n\nThe RGGC project offers concrete graph theoretic approaches to important challenges in the afore- mentioned fields.

While homogeneous transition metal catalysis is a potentially powerful means for achieving this objective, the fundamental organometallic chemistry of alkane activation reactions has proven to be exceedingly difficult to investigate due to the weakly interacting nature of alkanes. To address this knowledge gap and provide the foundation for future advancement of the field, ENTANGLED-TM-ALKANE outlines a systematic approach for the study of pivotal sigma\u2013alkane complex intermediates; nominally transient and extremely reactive metal-alkane adducts formed through coordination of an intact C\u2013H bond to the metal centre. Inspired from supramolecular chemistry, the approach involves the innovative use of systems containing alkane substrates held in close proximity to reactive metal centres through mechanical entanglement within supporting tridentate macrocyclic \u2018pincer\u2019 ligands (i.e. alkane based [2]rotaxanes and [2]catenanes). Through the interwoven topology of these systems, problematic dissociation reactions of sigma\u2013alkane complexes will be circumvented, facilitating isolation and ultimately enabling their structure and reaction chemistry to be probed in much greater detail than has been previously possible.
