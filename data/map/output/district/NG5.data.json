Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that following supervised endurance exercise training, 20% of subjects show no change in fitness and 30% demonstrate no improvement in insulin sensitivity or worse-still an adverse response. Our concept is that by using molecular profiling of blood/muscle samples we will develop personalised lifestyle intervention tools. Further, revealing the biological basis for a variable metabolic or cardiovascular response to exercise will enable us to propose new targets and biomarkers for drug discovery efforts directly in humans. Using our established OMICS approaches (RNA, DNA and Metabo-) we will generate classifiers that predict the responses to exercise-therapy (fitness and insulin sensitivity). Classifier generation is a statistical strategy for diagnosis or prognosis. Critically, we have a large human tissue biobank, including subjects with insulin-resistance; young to elderly males and females, as well as twins. Our SME partners have significant intellectual property and capacity in the field of bio-prediction, with a proven track-record of collaboration with the team and product development. We will add to the diversity of our biobank by carrying-out an exercise intervention study using a novel time-efficient strategy that we have recently proven to be effective in reducing insulin resistance in sedentary young people and in middle aged obese subjects. A time-efficient protocol is a critical as lack-of-time is a key reason for not maintaining physical activity levels. Finally, we have a novel out-bred rodent model that replicates high and low exercise training responses and we will establish its suitability for future drug screening purposes. Because of these substantial pre-existing resources we believe that our project has a very high probability of delivering on its goals of improving the healthcare of European citizens", 386171.0, 6321033.0, "META-PREDICT", "Diagnosing exercise resistance", "Regular physical activity does not have the same effect on fitness for everybody.

The point of departure is the recognition that technological innovation alone does not necessarily insure market acceptance. Instead, competitive environments require innovation that goes beyond technology to provide less tangible, but potentially more valuable, experiential benefits. The StageIt project is based on the notion of the \u201cexperience economy\u201d, which is the fourth stage in the progression of economic value, preceded by extracting fungible commodities, manufacturing tangible goods and delivering intangible services. Each stage in this progression represents a superior value proposition, with higher potential for competitive advantage. StageIt\u2019s industry-academia collaboration includes two universities and three SMEs that will benefit from transformation to experience staging. The academic participants contribute their knowledge, research findings and expertise and the industry participants contribute their practical experience prior to, during and following the transformation. The collaboration will make it possible to approach the transformation of SMEs into experience stagers from both a pragmatic and a theoretical point of view. Knowledge will be transferred within the consortium by staff secondments and workshops. Knowledge will be transferred to the broader academic and industrial communities through presentations in academic and industry conferences, academic publications and industry reports. The academic partners will raise the quality of their research on experiential design based on the data and insight gained. The industry partners will improve their RTD capability based on the knowledge gained from collaboration with the academic partners, and each other, and enhance their competitive advantage based on the transformations realized.", 135656.0, 612972.0, "STAGEIT", "SMEs and experience staging", "An EU team has helped European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) utilise the concept of experience staging.
