Our concept is that by using molecular profiling of blood/muscle samples we will develop personalised lifestyle intervention tools. Further, revealing the biological basis for a variable metabolic or cardiovascular response to exercise will enable us to propose new targets and biomarkers for drug discovery efforts directly in humans. Using our established OMICS approaches (RNA, DNA and Metabo-) we will generate classifiers that predict the responses to exercise-therapy (fitness and insulin sensitivity). Classifier generation is a statistical strategy for diagnosis or prognosis. Critically, we have a large human tissue biobank, including subjects with insulin-resistance; young to elderly males and females, as well as twins. Our SME partners have significant intellectual property and capacity in the field of bio-prediction, with a proven track-record of collaboration with the team and product development. We will add to the diversity of our biobank by carrying-out an exercise intervention study using a novel time-efficient strategy that we have recently proven to be effective in reducing insulin resistance in sedentary young people and in middle aged obese subjects.

The goal is to secure commitment of each stakeholders (public authorities, companies, CCIs\u2026) through concrete pledges to achieving the goals of the Alliance and call for others to follow the examples of the early pledgers but also to stimulate public and private financing to promote apprenticeship schemes.\r\nIn December 2013, Erasmus+ is approved by the European Council for 7 years (2013-2020) to achieve EU objectives for employment and growth matters particularly in the context of Europe 2020. Among them: the link of the world of education and of work, the adaptation of the trainings to the economic world as well as the increase of the number of mobilities of learners, trainers and staffs involved in the vocational training.\r\n\r\n> A national priority\r\n\r\nThe public authorities firmly believe that work-linked training makes it possible for young people both to learn a trade and to exercise it at the same time. This professional experience is a considerable advantage in a competitive job market.\r\nThe law on vocational training, employment and social democracy of March 5, 2014 seeks to facilitate the signature of apprenticeship contracts and to encourage European mobility for apprentices.\r\n\r\n\u201cMOVIL\u2019APP -European mobility and Apprenticeships\u201d: a commitment of CCIs and their partners\r\n\r\nSince 2007, the network of CCIs has worked to expand apprenticeships and European mobility by the running of its national project MOVIL\u2019APP (actually more than 50 apprentice training centres -covering 8 regions). CCIs, their apprentice training centres and partners are fully persuaded that mobility, even if only for short periods, makes the apprenticeship pathway more attractive and ensures that it is just as highly considered as traditional school-based learning.\r\nThe effectiveness of the project lies in the fact that the parties involved (CCI France, local/regional CCIs, apprentice training centres) have known one another for a long while, exchange know-how, pool best practices and produce valuable tools and resources (communication/management/methods\u2026). This enables the new CCIs/training centres joining the project to become operational very quickly and to capitalise on the skills and know-how already acquired by the network.\r\n\r\nThe target audiences for the MOVIL\u2019APP initiative are:\r\n\r\n* Apprentices, undergoing training (levels IV and V). These mobility assignments are of short duration as they take place during training and must therefore be compatible with the rhythm of the apprenticeships organisation and also require the employer\u2019s approval.\r\nFrom a professional viewpoint, the goals of mobility are discovering new working environments and of course gaining self-confidence. From a personal viewpoint, the main impacts are achieving a better understanding of the European area and modifying one's behaviour (improving tolerance, curiosity and adaptability\u2026).\r\n\r\n* Post-apprentices. These are young people graduated (level V to I qualifications in all business sectors) from the apprentice training centers of the CCI and their partners who have completed their apprenticeship contract during the last 12 months. They are registered at the French unemployment service, registration that qualify them as \u201ctrainee undertaking vocational training\u201d. \r\nA long-duration mobility placement enables those people to improve their employability by upgrading their skills, particularly linguistic skills, and their adaptability in the international labour market.\r\n\r\n*Trainers. Usually, when we talk about mobility in vocational training we're first and obviously thinking about apprentices and post-apprentices. But, trainers need to confront their point of view with other European practices. For this reason, the MOVIL\u2019APP project proposes a mobility placement to all professionals involved in apprenticeships. Moreover, being fully convinced of the value of mobility projects, they will be then better able to encourage and promote its development. The project plans the incoming of 4 trainers in company to contribute to the training of apprentices.\r\n\r\nMOVIL\u2019APP also has an impact on the indirect beneficiaries of the MOVIL\u2019APP initiative. Therefore, for the apprentice training centres, the project is a source of pedagogical innovation\u2026 For national and European companies, mobility provides contact with other practices and helps with the forging of economic partnerships.\r\n\r\nSummary of the CCI France application 2017:\r\n=>1846 grants requested\r\n-1360 apprentices (average duration 16 days) + 128 accompanying persons\r\n- 293 post-apprentices (average of 5.5 months)\r\n- 65 trainers with 4 incoming people (average of 6 days)\r\nThe main training fields are: hotel catering, retail trade, food, auto mechanic, personal services...\r\nThe main host country ES UK IT IE", "http://www.destination.eu.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036275_8"], ["0FU", "Un levier pour l'emploi IV", "Destination Europe", 1120938.0, "P\u00f4le emploi wants to carry an Erasmus+ project for the 2017-2019 period in order to offer to jobseekers a European mobility opportunity.

The foreign host companies will nominate a tutor for the apprentices: this person will provide guidance, advice and training and will follow the progress of the young people during their mobility period. The above-mentioned Chambers of Trades and Crafts (CMA) will be in charge of implementing the call for applications and selecting the successful candidates amongst those apprentices interested by a period of mobility. They will furthermore be responsible for organising every aspect of the trip - logistics, travel, accommodation as well as producing written feedback on the experience that will, in particular, analyse the positive aspects and identify areas for improvement (impact assessment, results widespreading, methods to improve future mobility periods). Foreign partners will be in charge of selecting the host companies depending on the activities requested by each apprentice in order to ensure that the work experience that is offered matches to each apprentice\u2019s specific requirements. \r\n\r\nFinally the regional coordinator (CRMA NA) will be in charge of the global support of the CMA and the overall consistency of the planned actions and the long-term follow-up of the project.\r\n\r\nThe expected results will be put to good use in each Vocational Training Centre via improved and completed programmes which will take into account the European dimension. The apprentices will be wealthier thanks to these new professional experiences and the knowledge they will have acquired through that mobility.\r\n\r\nOur project will impact both the participants and the participating organisations. By placing the apprentice at the heart of the scheme, he/she will benefit from the added value of this new experience and display a whole new dimension in their life, whether as adult individuals, professionals or European citizens.\r\n\r\nOne of the long-term benefits we hope to obtain through our mobility project is to contribute to a more peaceful society, caring to young people and which is concerned about helping them to find their place.", "http://www.destination.eu.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036862_3"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["9RG", "Food Enterprise Advisory Support Team (FEAST)", "Food & drink Forum", "The Food Enterprise Advisory Support Team (FEAST) is a new dynamic business support programme targeting the priority D2N2, SEMLEP and NEP Food and Drink sectors.
