All participants are confronted with the effects and the management of a heterogeneous classroom. More specifically, the special care needs of children with developmental disabilities. The educational psychologist, even if not in charge of a class, is also confronted with the special needs of these students. \r\n\r\nThis project is organized around four key moments which are the mobilities. \r\n1 / A first mobility will give the participants the possibility of training in English in order to improve their English skills and thus be able to perform better in the classroom and to take full advantage of the future exchanges on structured courses which will be conducted in English.\r\n2 / A second mobility will enable the participants, during an observation period in Finland, to understand how children with special educational needs are managed and integrated efficiently and effectively in ordinary classes in order to adopt certain new practices in our own classrooms.\r\n3 / The third mobility will offer the participants a structured course, both theoretical and practical, with field observations, regarding the inclusion of children with developmental disabilities, according to the specificity of the Icelandic education system.\r\n4 / The latest mobility will bring new tools through art therapy in order to better integrate these children with developmental disabilities in our ordinary classes.\r\n\r\nBeyond these mobilities, this project will be organized around regular meetings to prepare the mobilities but also around assessment meetings with all the parties involved to better determine the impact of these new tools in our practices for students. These practices will be evaluated by all before being established in our school project. Communication events throughout the project will enable the whole community to take part in a European experience.\r\n\r\nWe hope to create European inclinations by reinforcing a sense of European citizenship among all the parties involved in this project. For our pedagogical team, this project could be extended by a strategic partnership (KA2) with several schools on complementary or different themes according to the opportunities encountered.\r\n\r\nThis project constitutes a major training opportunity at this stage of our career. This project enables us to have an active role in our training and allows us to question our practices through the experiences and the knowledge of other cultures and educational systems.\r\nBenefiting from the experiences and the knowledge of other European countries will strengthen our practices to better integrate students with developmental disabilities into our ordinary classes and thereby contribute to a better inclusion of people with disabilities into our society.", "http://www.leaponline.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA101-035885_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WS5"}
