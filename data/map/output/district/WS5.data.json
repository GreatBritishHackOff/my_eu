Based in Newcastle under Lyme Staffordshire, it operates nationally through local franchises and currently has 15 licensees and approximately 450 learners. It delivers language courses for adults where the focus is on fun and conversation rather than results and written work. It expanded into Spanish in 2010 and whereas French classes are delivered at all levels (Beginners, Improvers, Intermediate and Advanced), Spanish is currently only delivered up to Improvers level. In order to successfully expand the area of the business devoted to delivering Spanish courses to adults, there is a need to optimise the quality of the teaching in this area. The proficiency of tutors themselves in the target language is of paramount importance in professionally delivering courses to paying students and in enhancing the reputation and image of the organisation. \r\nIt is a key need, therefore, of the organisation to enable its tutors and licensees to continuously improve their knowledge and understanding of, in this case, Spanish, thereby increasing their competence and confidence in using it. There is also an ongoing need for developing and refining existing materials, tools and techniques used in the classroom. As a small organisation it is critical to be able to share good practice with others working in the same field and to provide relevant training to its licensees and tutors within tight budgetary restraints.\r\nThe selected course relevant to this application is the Training Course in Teaching and Learning of Spanish Language and Culture (Adult Education) in Malaga organised by LEAP. The specific educational aims of the course match closely those identified above, namely:\r\n\u2022 develop knowledge and understanding of the\r\n   target language\r\n\u2022 increase competence and confidence in using the\r\n   target language\r\n\u2022 further develop knowledge and understanding\r\n   of teaching techniques for specific groups, and\r\n   provide teachers with an array of ready-made\r\n   teaching resources suitable for their learners\r\n\u2022 provide an opportunity to share good practice\r\n\u2022 provide participants with an opportunity to work\r\n  collaboratively in developing their own teaching\r\n  materials\r\nThe intended participant is a linguist by background with A levels in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Latin and a Ba Hons in French from the University of Leeds.

He spent his career until recently working in Export Sales for a variety of British manufacturers travelling extensively in Western and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, North America and the Caribbean, Africa and a little in the Far East and using his language skills whilst doing so. He starting teaching at Newcastle under Lyme College and Language for Fun four years ago and now teaches mainly for Language for Fun. In 2013 he graduated as a fully qualified teacher gaining a DTLLS with merit from Staffordshire University.He is our licensee for Spanish and French for a number of towns around Newcastle and for Spanish for Newcastle itself and his number of students continues to grow. Due to his success in building up new and existing teaching venues for Spanish and his commitment to the business going forward, he has shown that investment in further training is very likely to bring benefit to the organisation. His good interpersonal skills also makes him the ideal candidate to share the benefits of his training across the organisation with other licensees  However he does need to improve his Spanish to increase his confidence and competence at a higher level.\r\nThe expected impact of the course is to: maximise the motivation, confidence and competence of the participant and support his need for professional and personal development; improve the ability of the organisation to deliver high quality Spanish tuition thereby enhancing its reputation and image and enabling it to grow the business in the identified target market; optimise the experience of its learners in attending courses which in turn will help the business grow through word of mouth; help to develop relationships between British and Spanish nationals .", "http://www.leaponline.eu", "Language for Fun Ltd", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA104-000034_1"], ["3DH", "Fast Forward on Innovation and Quality", "Language Education And Partnerships  LTD", 15151.0, "On the one hand, the \"Fast Forward on Innovation and Quality\" project is meant to contribute directly to Babel Center's developmental strategy as provider of foreign language teaching services to adults.  On the other hand, it contributes to the organization's strategic objective to become an innovation center as far as working with adults is concerned locally, nationally and internationally.\r\n\r\nBabel Center was set up 9 years ago by a group of young teachers who believe in lifelong learning and have always looked for ways to best answer the adults' need of learning a foreign language in the easiest and most enjoyable way possible. In time the team of teachers has grown, as well as the number of languages taught (at the moment there are 10). The needs of the adult learners have also changed together with the new technologies and increasing opportunities of using a foreign language. At this stage, the challenge for the organization is to find creative ways to respond to the needs of the adult learners, to keep them interested in the whole range of foreign languages, i. e. to build up a system that assures high quality of the courses delivered and keeps teachers motivated to develop professionally and innovate.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge for the organization is to positions itself within the international context of foreign language teaching. In 2010-2012 we ran our first Learning Partnership project within the Grundtvig Program. Having had the chance to collaborate with other 8 institutions, most of them foreign language teaching centers, has proved the importance of learning in an international context, and has also indicated ways in which the Babel team can contribute through its expertise to creating a European know-how in this field. During the last 2 years, the confidence in the teachers' expertise has grown as a result of the excellent feedback they have received for presentations and workshops delivered at local, national and international conferences and seminars. In this sense, establishing international contacts and access to the best resources of expertise in 2014-2015 can mean a leap forward towards the the higher goal of bringing Romanian added value to the European level by means of future partnership projects, as well as by a high quality offer of Erasmus+ trainings in the field of teaching foreign languages.\r\n\r\nThe project \"Fast Forward on Innovation and Quality\" fulfills its objectives by organizing 9 European mobilities which involves the participation on 13 members of the organization. Special attention has been given that all levels of the organization are offered the opportunity of international mobility, from Junior trainers to the management team taking into consideration their motivation and area of interest/ expertise, as well as their ability to disseminate information on a local, national and international level.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the project are coordinated by a support team, consisting of people with experience in international collaborations and project management. The project involves a stage of preparing the mobilities, of 9 actions taking place throughout 2014-2015, of organizing dissemination activities in various frameworks (in the organization, in Edu-Cafe - the Resource Center for Teachers, national and international conferences, The Romanian Institute for Adult Teaching) and assessment.\r\n\r\nThe 9 actions represent participation at training sessions for developing creative methodologies in language teaching and for creating learning communities (Creative Methodology, The Creative Classroom, Building Positive Group Dynamics), using new technologies and adapting them to future requirements (Future Learning - Using Ipads and Tablets, Education for Tomorrow) and for developing high quality systems (Teach. Learn, Quality, Finnish Lessons for European Schools), and finally for developing linguistic, cultural and methodological competences in teaching the Roman languages, i. e. French and Italian.\r\n\r\nThe results of taking part at these mobilities will be a set of individual competences connected to latest knowledge, which are extremely important abilities for the 21st century trainer and for the management of an innovative school.  On top of that, increased self-confidence and inter-cultural openness within the European context will boost participants' motivation to exchange views in various dissemination activities and in future projects possibly generated within the networking done during these mobilities.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of the project, including the way the present application has been written, the proposed approach is one of partnership and responsibility of all parties involved. Both the training providers and the participants are partners in this project, having in mind that the needs of all those involved are as important as the needs of the organization.

Moreover, the majority  has only basic ITskills, at lessons using only to a small extent the It resources, and their teaching practices are traditional, lacking modern ITapproaches . \r\n2)to introduce and change something according to the direction endorsed by the Ministry, the Europe 2020 strategy (integration of IT in education), the management team finds that it is not prepared to implement the change (to be one with long\u2013term effects, sustainable and to ensure the institutional progress). The management team considers the opportunity of the institutional development to be possible only through the correct, consistent and sustainable integration of the new technologies in the teaching act (interactive boards and tablets). The management team needs to adopt a new management strategy based on a well defined digital learning policy, with consistent and appropriate activities and an efficient use  of the management tools (management plan, procedures). The team considers that all these things may be learnt and that teachers may be trained within the structured courses provided by the EU host organisations with valuable experiences and results in the areas described above.  Thus, the purpose of the project is to foster the modernization of the education provided by the school, by developing and steering digital learning policies with a representative target group from the teaching staff (11 teachers out of 38), which will use an innovative approach and expand the use of ICT in the educational process, developing the digital learning with interactive whiteboards and tablets as attractive and effective means of study, between 1.09.2015-1.09.2017. The project correlates with 3 targets of the IDP and with  the EDP. \r\nThe target group is represented by 11 teachers (29%) who will attend 4 structured courses on the following themes:1.Leadership in Education-FN (3 teachers-Admin.Council); 2.Tap-Swipe-Pinch.

Becoming Confident Users of Interactive whiteboards & Developing Educational Links Within Europe, UK (2 teachers,1 primary teacher).\r\nThe Courses entitles the beneficiaries with good EU practices, policies, strategies and management tools, and also  digital skills (technical and methodical) in using  the interactive whiteboards and tablets. They provide the participants with opportunities of identifying and establishing new partners in Europe.\r\nAfter the mobilities:\r\n-3 members of the Admin.Council will develop a school policy regarding the digital learning, will review the management plans to ensure its steering, will use other management tools of projecting-organising-monitoring-control-assessment with European influence, so as to realise the activities from the Personal Development Plan (in no more than one month after the mobility \u2013up to Aug 2017).\r\n-8  beneficiaries of the courses 2, 3 ,4 will define  the Personal plan and will integrate in the lessons what they have achieved during the courses (they will design units of learning and lessons based on the integration of tablets and interactive boards and will hold classes/extracurricular activities with these resources).\r\n-all the beneficiaries: will disseminate the learning outcomes permanently, the professional experiences gained from the integration of what they have learned, will collaborate in groups/mobility to develop some materials which will be included in a Good Practices Guide. \r\n- based on what they have achieved by attending these courses, they will hold 5 workshops to train the other colleagues from the school and from the AdminCouncil in order to familiarize them with the European management and didactic practices and expand the policy for digital learning\r\n- will collaborate with the reception organization, with their former colleagues from the courses  and wwill initiate at least 3 European activities with with ITCintegration in curriculum up to 1.09. 2017 (2 eTwinning projects+1KA2 application.", "http://www.leaponline.eu", null, "erasmus_2015-1-RO01-KA101-014623_2"], ["3DH", "Teaching students not content - towards a more child centered pedagogy in the Early Years.", "Language Education And Partnerships  LTD", 14566.0, "Teaching Students not Content - Towards a more Child Centered pedagogy in the Early Years.

Practices in the EU countries are different, all of which tend to be as inclusive as possible, helping people with special needs to live a full, happy and satisfied life. We consider it important to educate school staff and to acquire competences in the field of teaching people with special needs also beyond the borders, as we expand our horizons and establish contacts with institutions across Europe.\r\nWe want to learn about different ways of integrating pupils with special needs into elementary education. We want to know innovative methods and forms of work, to gain practical experience and competences for improving the educational process. We want to get to know what the system solutions are in some other EU countries. We want to update our classes, both in the curriculum of the adapted programme, as well as in the departments of the regular elementary school programme. We want to update the visual image of the classrooms of the adjusted programme, we want to introduce new ways of transition between an adjusted primary school programme, a programme with adjusted implementation and additional professional help and a regular elementary school programme.\r\nThere will be eight professional workers from our school who will be educated: two pedagogue teachers, a special pedagogue teacher, a librarian, a teacher of physical education and a foreign language teacher - English, two class teachers. Everybody at school works with people with special needs every day.\r\nThe main activities of the project will be related to the professional training and practical knowledge and experience that will be gained through these trainings. We will educate ourselves in the field of prosocial behavior, we will gain new ideas about the inclusion of children with special needs and handling conflict situations, improve our knowledge of foreign language and cross-curricular links, and we will educate about different school systems in terms of inclusion in the EU. We will acquire theoretical knowledge, practical aspects and competences in the field of inclusion of persons with special needs in education throughout Europe. After individual training, the acquired knowledge will first be expanded within the collective  as well as wider in the local community.
