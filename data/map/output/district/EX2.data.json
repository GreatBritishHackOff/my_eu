They commercialise small volumes of low-emission vehicles, including taxis, delivery vans, factory vehicles and domestic cars. However with current technologies their market is limited and their development has been split between low-cost mass market and expensive high-performance vehicles. These vehicles do not meet customer performance demands, at a price point which is competitive with IC engines. Large vehicle manufacturers overcome this gap and reduce their development costs by platform sharing component technologies. However due to the lack of collaboration within our industry, this platform technology is not available. This proposal addresses this technology gap though the development of an open platform power management system, with customisable performance and efficiency. The platform will be supported by a modular platform drive motor topology, based on a fully scalable axial flux design (100Nm to 1,200Nm cont. torque). The low cost technology will be sufficiently high torque to drive the wheels at a high speed, without requiring an intermediate gearbox. To further drive down cost we will use the housing of the liquid cooled drive motor, as a heat sink for a high current power convertor. This will be achieved by applying a circuit board directly onto the motor housing, using a thermal spraying technology. The project will benefit Europe through increased sales of low-emission vehicles and enable our members to reduce development time by 20% and component cost by 40%. The modular drive motor platform will enable our members to manufacturer desirable vehicles at a competitive price and reduce the total vehicle cost by up to 13%. In addition we will offset imports by EU manufacturing of new drive motors, increasing European revenues by \u20ac257 million and profits by \u20ac51 million.", 17138.0, 2604557.0, "SAFEDRIVE", "New motors to boost electric and hybrid cars", "An initiative to advance and unify drivetrain technology for electric and hybrid cars could help European businesses in the field significantly. It will also bring the continent closer to a greener land transport model.", "About 1\u00a0600 European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), mostly automotive industry manufacturers and suppliers, are working on developing cutting-edge hybrid, electric and fuel cell technology for vehicles. These businesses face many challenges, particularly since there is no common drivetrain platform for applications under development, giving an advantage to larger multinational vehicle manufacturers.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'A platform power management system and low voltage drive train for hybrid and electric vehicles' (http://www.safedrive-fp7.eu (SAFEDRIVE)) supported European SME electric vehicle manufacturers in penetrating the electric vehicle market. It worked on developing a scalable, modular electric drivetrain to suit different types of electric and hybrid vehicles such as small cars, trucks and utility vehicles.\n\nEnvisioning a new motor design that requires lowering the voltage of direct current (DC) systems, SAFEDRIVE worked on a new split-Pi DC-to-DC converter and a power management/distribution system. The modular DC motor would eliminate the need for a gearbox, enabling direct drive operation through a drive shaft or as a hub motor. The project team developed an efficient bi-directional DC-to-DC converter in the drivetrain between the modular motors and power sources (super capacitor, lithium-ion batteries, motor-generator set).\n\nTo achieve its aims, SAFEDRIVE brought together SME supply chain partners, associations and end-users from across Europe. The project partners investigated existing technologies and developed the software behind the control and power management of the drivetrain. This was followed by production of new circuit boards, design of the drivetrain component parts and integration into a prototype.\n\nTowards the end of the project the team was very close to completing a fully functional electric vehicle drivetrain with an innovative modular DC motor that produces the desired torque. All the project's results have been disseminated to stakeholders, laying the groundwork for a unified drivetrain that could boost SME results in the field. Thanks to this initiative, Europe has come one step closer to becoming a leader in producing cleaner vehicles.", null, "http://www.scimar.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112212.jpg", "fp7_95937_991906093"], ["7HY", "Enabling access to geological information in support of GMES", "Landmark Information Group", "PanGeo is a service proposed in response to FP7 GMES Downstream Call 3 (released July 2009).  The objective of PanGeo is to enable free and open access to geohazard information in support of GMES.  This will be achieved by the generation of a validated Geohazard Data Layer supported by a Geohazard Summary for 52 of the largest towns listed in the GMES Land Theme\u2019s Urban Atlas involving all 27 countries of the EU.  Upon user enquiry, a PanGeo web-portal will automatically integrate the geohazard data with the Urban Atlas to highlight the polygons influenced.  The datasets will be made discoverable, accessible and useable via a distributed web-map system as built and demonstrated by OneGeology Europe (www.onegeology-europe.eu).\n\nThe key users of PanGeo are anticipated as:\n\u2022\tLocal Authority planners and regulators who are concerned with managing development risk,\n\u2022\tNational geological surveys and geoscience institutes who are obliged to collect geohazard data for public benefit,\n\u2022\tPolicy-makers concerned with assessing and comparing European geological risk, much as the Urban Atlas data is used to compare the landcover/use status of European towns.\n\nProducts will be made by integrating: a) interpreted InSAR terrain-motion data (derived from existing projects, e.g. ESA GSE Terrafirma plus new processing), b) geological information, and c) the landcover and landuse data contained within the Urban Atlas.  The integration and interpretation, plus a validation of key features observed, will be made by the corresponding national Geological Survey for the towns concerned.  It is planned to deliver the service for two Urban Atlas towns in each country of the EU (Luxembourg and Cyprus only 1), equalling fifty-two towns in total.  The geological survey concerned will choose the towns for processing from the Urban Atlas list using their own knowledge as to where the information will be of most use, probably the largest towns, which, when extrapolated, would equal (13% of total EU urban population).  User input to design will be facilitated by the Surveys contracted into the project and initiation of  \u2018Local Authority Feedback Group\u2019.\n\nTerrafirma has shown the potential for the self-sustainability of services providing InSAR-derived terrain-motion data, as 30% of users have gone on to procure further product on a commercial basis.

Yet, information about geohazards and their effects can be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. EU-funded scientists looked to Copernicus, the European Earth observation programme (formerly named Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), to generate information on natural and man-made geohazards.\n\nThe 'Enabling access to geological information in support of GMES' (http://www.pangeoproject.eu/ (PANGEO)) project was initiated with the goal to enable free and open access to geohazard information through Copernicus. This was achieved by developing an online geohazard information service for the two largest towns in each EU Member State.\n\nWith the exception of Cyprus and Luxembourg, where information is provided for one city only, the PANGEO service covers about 13\u00a0% of the EU's population. The information includes two geohazard data products: a new ground stability layer and accompanying interpretation that are produced by 27 national geological surveys.\n\nThe surveys use their geohazard information in combination with measurements of terrain motion supplied by satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radars. Urban maps are supplied after integrating land-cover and land-use data from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Services. The PANGEO data can be viewed on the project website and in Google Earth.\n\nUpon user enquiry for a given town, the service automatically integrates the ground stability layer with corresponding data from the Copernicus Urban Atlas at a resolution of 2.5\u00a0metres. The PANGEO service is entirely free to use and the data products downloadable (as PDF files) to enable integration into the user's geographic information system.\n\nThis wealth of information is targeted at local authorities, civil protection agencies, insurers, businesses and interested members of the general public. For example, local authority planners and regulators can now make more informed decisions on spatial planning in areas of instability. Governments can take remedial action in geologically susceptible zones to avoid high costs from possible disaster.\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of the PANGEO service, additional European towns that the Urban Atlas will cover can join the online system, once all the datasets are available.

Strong reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are necessary to reach the global warming target agreed on at the 2015 United Nations Convention of Parties in Paris. Such emission reductions can only be achieved if sources are properly quantified and mitigation efforts are verified, but there are large discrepancies between official emission inventories and estimates derived from direct measurement of the air.\nMEMO2 will contribute to the EU2020 targets with a focus on methane (CH4), the second most important greenhouse gas after CO2 and one of Europe\u2019s most important energy sources. CH4 emissions are a major contributor to Europe's global warming impact, but they are also a good target for climate change mitigation because of a rather short lifetime of 10 years (policy-maker compatible) and several sources offering possibilities of \u201cno-regret\u201d emission reduction (landfills, gas leaks, manure). However CH4 emissions are not well quantified yet.\nMEMO2 will bridge the gap between large-scale scientific estimates from in situ monitoring programs and the 'bottom-up' estimates of emissions from local sources that are used in the national reporting. MEMO2 will identify and evaluate CH4 emissions and support mitigation measures by I) developing new and advanced mobile methane measurements tools and networks, isotopic source identification, and modelling at different scales, and II) educating a new generation of \u201ccross\u2013thinking\u201d scientists, which are able to effectively implement novel measurement and modelling tools in an interdisciplinary and intersectoral context. \nThe 9 beneficiaries and 13 non-academic partners of MEMO2 offer a well\u2013structured intersectoral training programme to equip young researchers with strong scientific and personal competencies, which will enhance their employability as well as European innovation capacity in the future.", null, 2934698.0, "MEMO2", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_205416_940955582"], ["7HR", "Advanced Carbon Materials from Biowaste: Sustainable Pathways to Drive Innovative Green Technologies", "Viridor Waste Management Limited", "The energy crisis, environmental pollution and global warming are serious problems that are of great concern throughout the world.
