They commercialise small volumes of low-emission vehicles, including taxis, delivery vans, factory vehicles and domestic cars. However with current technologies their market is limited and their development has been split between low-cost mass market and expensive high-performance vehicles. These vehicles do not meet customer performance demands, at a price point which is competitive with IC engines. Large vehicle manufacturers overcome this gap and reduce their development costs by platform sharing component technologies. However due to the lack of collaboration within our industry, this platform technology is not available. This proposal addresses this technology gap though the development of an open platform power management system, with customisable performance and efficiency. The platform will be supported by a modular platform drive motor topology, based on a fully scalable axial flux design (100Nm to 1,200Nm cont. torque). The low cost technology will be sufficiently high torque to drive the wheels at a high speed, without requiring an intermediate gearbox. To further drive down cost we will use the housing of the liquid cooled drive motor, as a heat sink for a high current power convertor. This will be achieved by applying a circuit board directly onto the motor housing, using a thermal spraying technology. The project will benefit Europe through increased sales of low-emission vehicles and enable our members to reduce development time by 20% and component cost by 40%. The modular drive motor platform will enable our members to manufacturer desirable vehicles at a competitive price and reduce the total vehicle cost by up to 13%. In addition we will offset imports by EU manufacturing of new drive motors, increasing European revenues by \u20ac257 million and profits by \u20ac51 million.", 17138.0, 2604557.0, "SAFEDRIVE", "New motors to boost electric and hybrid cars", "An initiative to advance and unify drivetrain technology for electric and hybrid cars could help European businesses in the field significantly.

These businesses face many challenges, particularly since there is no common drivetrain platform for applications under development, giving an advantage to larger multinational vehicle manufacturers.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'A platform power management system and low voltage drive train for hybrid and electric vehicles' (http://www.safedrive-fp7.eu (SAFEDRIVE)) supported European SME electric vehicle manufacturers in penetrating the electric vehicle market. It worked on developing a scalable, modular electric drivetrain to suit different types of electric and hybrid vehicles such as small cars, trucks and utility vehicles.\n\nEnvisioning a new motor design that requires lowering the voltage of direct current (DC) systems, SAFEDRIVE worked on a new split-Pi DC-to-DC converter and a power management/distribution system. The modular DC motor would eliminate the need for a gearbox, enabling direct drive operation through a drive shaft or as a hub motor. The project team developed an efficient bi-directional DC-to-DC converter in the drivetrain between the modular motors and power sources (super capacitor, lithium-ion batteries, motor-generator set).\n\nTo achieve its aims, SAFEDRIVE brought together SME supply chain partners, associations and end-users from across Europe. The project partners investigated existing technologies and developed the software behind the control and power management of the drivetrain. This was followed by production of new circuit boards, design of the drivetrain component parts and integration into a prototype.\n\nTowards the end of the project the team was very close to completing a fully functional electric vehicle drivetrain with an innovative modular DC motor that produces the desired torque. All the project's results have been disseminated to stakeholders, laying the groundwork for a unified drivetrain that could boost SME results in the field.

Urban maps are supplied after integrating land-cover and land-use data from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Services. The PANGEO data can be viewed on the project website and in Google Earth.\n\nUpon user enquiry for a given town, the service automatically integrates the ground stability layer with corresponding data from the Copernicus Urban Atlas at a resolution of 2.5\u00a0metres. The PANGEO service is entirely free to use and the data products downloadable (as PDF files) to enable integration into the user's geographic information system.\n\nThis wealth of information is targeted at local authorities, civil protection agencies, insurers, businesses and interested members of the general public. For example, local authority planners and regulators can now make more informed decisions on spatial planning in areas of instability. Governments can take remedial action in geologically susceptible zones to avoid high costs from possible disaster.\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of the PANGEO service, additional European towns that the Urban Atlas will cover can join the online system, once all the datasets are available.

Most of the large companies in the area have disappeared, leading many small businesses to close down as well, causing a tsunami effect. As a result of that, we can find  many unemployed low-skilled people with little chance of finding a job. Many of them are looking forward  to improving their situation and some are enrolled in the Administrative Management Training Course, which is the subject of this Erasmus + Project. The lack of alternatives, the promotion of employment, the promotion of social equity and inclusion are the main factors that have triggered the presentation of this proposal.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nFor the IES Francesc Gil, if this proposal is accepted, it would mean the mobility of 6 students of the 2nd Basic Education course and the Medium-level Training Course in Administrative Management. Regarding the type of mobility of personnel, this would involve the mobility of 3 teachers from the Administration and Management Department of our school.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the host partners:\r\n\r\n- The Lyc\u00e9e Professionnel Notre Dame, in Castres (France). It is an institution with extensive experience in European projects, Comenius, Leonardo Da Vinci and Erasmus +. Through this educational center, IES Francesc Gil has established relationships with companies in the administrative sector in which students perform part of their training. The Lyc\u00e9e is a partner we definitely rely on since we have jointly carried out previous European projects (Leonardo Da Vinci and Erasmus +).\r\n\r\n- The Lyc\u00e9e Professionnel Golf H\u00f4tel in Hy\u00e8res (France). This partner provides the contacts and the corresponding logistics to approach the realization of the FCT (training at workplace) by the students. And also contacts with the Reception Partners (companies) where the practices will be carried out.\r\n\r\n- IPC Exeter, in the UK. This center will provide training in CLIL methodology for teaching staff.\r\n- Sprachschule Zum Ehrstein, in Germany, with regard to training in Dual FP (dual vocational courses).\r\n- And as a novelty, St. Caterine High School will provide training in entrepreneurship through Job-Shadowing and the creation of materials. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES:\r\n\r\nWithin the period of validity of the project there will be two truns of students mobility, consisting each of 4 weeks of internship and cultural preparation at destination. The first of them  is planned for the 2017/2018 academic year and the second one for the 2018/2019 academic year.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is planned to train a teacher of the Department of Administration and Management of the center in the CLIL methodology for the subsequent teaching of non-linguistic subjects in English. Another mobility of teachers for training in Dual Vocational Training. And also another mobility of teachers through observation or Job-Shadowing with the objective of introducing the knowledge in different subjects and the didactic materials elaborated in English.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\n\r\nIf the students are evaluated with \"pass\", this will result in the partial validation of the FCT (training at workplace) module with the corresponding hours.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it will also be certified with Europass, Youthpass, diploma of language preparation as well as diploma and certificate of the IES Francesc Gil that testify the realization of the students' residency.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the training of the teaching staff, it is expected that during the next two courses (2017/2018 and 2019/2020), non-linguistic modules may be taught in English in the Basic Vocational Training Course and in the Administrative Management Training Course in our school. It is also expected that this will apply to the Plurilingual Program of other courses in our school, IES  Francesc Gil.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Dual Vocational Training, it is planned to apply the good practices observed in other countries to the project that is now starting at IES Francesc Gil.\r\n\r\nLONG TERM BENEFITS:\r\n\r\n- As a differentiating element of the IES Francesc Gil compared to other schools in the area that offer courses of the same professional field, as regards the quality of its offer of FP (vocational training).\r\n\r\n- Promotion of the participation of various social agents of our region involved in issues of Youth and Employment.\r\n\r\n- Dynamic element to enhance the participation in other European projects in the future.\r\n\r\n- Integrating element with the rest of the Educational Community.
