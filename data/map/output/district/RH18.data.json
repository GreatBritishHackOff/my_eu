This approach will drive model based pharmaceutical product development in accordance with visions of Quality by Design. Benefits include an accelerated formulation development process, particularly for challenging projects e.g. for low solubility molecules or modified-release formulations as well as allowing optimization of clinical product performance for patient benefit. In addition, it will significantly reduce the need for future animal experiments in this area and reduce the need for human bioequivalence studies for bridging between formulations within clinical programmes.

In particular, milk and dairy products can be contaminated by aflatoxin M1, a potent carcinogen. The aflatoxin contamination represents a hazard for human health and an economic loss for the dairy industry. The available technology for aflatoxin detection is i) laboratory-based, ii) requires sample preparation, iii) does not provide timely identification of the carcinogen, thus iv) fails to deliver cost-effective management of contaminated milk.<br/>In this context, the SYMPHONY project aims to overcome these limitations by the integration of heterogeneous technologies, encompassing photonics, microfluidics and system integration, in a miniaturised smart system that will perform low cost label free detection of aflatoxin in milk and prevent infection of dairy products. The  main goal is to produce an automated sampling and analysis system to be used on-line in Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP). In our strategy the following key enabling technologies will converge:<br/>1) microfluidic technologies and biochemistry, to provide a miniaturised device capable of sample purification and pre-concentration by using the selectivity of aptamers and antibodies;2) photonic resonators integrated in microsystem technologies, for highly sensitive detection;3) compact hardware for the integration in the production chain and communication interfaces compatible with the information system of the industry.<br/>In our vision, the system will represent a breakthrough for the dairy industry, leading toward precision process management.
