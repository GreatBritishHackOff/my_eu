Over 50% of expenditure in the EU construction sector is on repair of existing structures rather than on new build. The primary material of construction requiring repair in EU is concrete. The annual cost of repair of reinforced concrete structures in Western Europe is in excess of \u20ac5 billion, a problem which is likely to be even greater in Eastern Europe. Wide scale research undertaken by EU FP5 project CONREPNET 2004 showed that 25% of structure owners are unhappy with the performance of the repair within five years after the rehabilitation of reinforced concrete structures; 75% are dissatisfied within ten years. This has generated a requirement to deliver more durable and effective repairs to concrete structures. To meet this requirement, this MCure project will scientifically develop a novel accelerated curing approach which will improve the durability, accelerate the curing and consistency of concrete repairs, independent of climatic environment. It will be an energy and time efficient curing system. It will make more efficient use of resources, especially in harsh winter weather conditions due to the system robustness and the effectiveness of the technology in all kinds of weather. This approach will improve the productivity and competitiveness of SME repairs contractors. This technological approach will involve advancements in the fields of remote moisture sensing and concrete compressive strength. Background research has validated the technical concept and the market opportunity. Within five post project years, MCure will generate at least 215 new jobs in EU and additional revenues of over\u20ac28 million for the SMEPs.", 1752.0, 1311624.0, "MCURE", "More durable repairs of concrete structures", "More than half of EU expenditures in the construction sector are on repair of existing structures, most commonly those made of reinforced concrete.

While the construction sector is a pillar of the EU economy, it also represents about 40\u00a0% of its total energy consumption and generates about one third of all greenhouse gases in Europe.\n\nA new energy-efficient system for accelerated curing during repair of concrete structures is being developed with EU support of the http://www.mcure-fp7.eu/ (MCURE) project. It will be applicable in all environmental conditions, including harsh winters in northern climates.\n\nMCURE promises to address all sides of the multi-faceted problem. The system will improve repair performance while decreasing energy consumption and reducing capital and maintenance costs. Overall, it will also enhance the productivity and competitive position of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) doing the repairs.\n\nLab-scale investigations have been carried out on cube samples of various volumes using microwave powers of varying intensities leading to definition of optimum process parameters. Preliminary results demonstrate the ability of the system to outperform current state-of-the-art concrete curing techniques. The two most important measures are temperature and moisture. Researchers are now developing selected moisture measurement techniques after a thorough literature search and in-depth discussions.\n\nA team of scientists and engineers is designing the MCURE prototype that will exploit an optimum energy coupling mechanism and a driving system to repair materials. The finalised optimal curing system design has been determined based on process requirements and the microwave transmission system specifications supported by simulation work.\n\nDuring the next reporting period, the prototype will be manufactured and tested on a variety of samples in order to optimise it for specific applications. The team predicts that conventional curing systems will require 30\u00a0% more capital investment than the MCURE system, which is also expected to slash energy consumption for considerable additional benefits.

The risk that a small quantity of an explosive, below the threshold of the detection instruments, could get undetected should be considered, and the introduction of contermeasures to reduce the effects of on-board explosions should be considered.  This is the idea behind FLY-BAG.

The issue of containing explosions aboard narrow-body aircraft must be resolved.  Our concept is based on the development of flexible textile-based luggage containers able to resist a small to medium explosion by controlled expansion and containment of the shock waves whilst, at the same time, preventing hard luggage fragment projectiles (shrapnel) from striking the main structure of the aircraft at high speed.  A multi-layered 'soft-sandwich' structure is required to absorb the large dynamic loads of the explosion and the large deformation related to the gas expansion. Our idea is to use a multi-axial textile structures made of ballistic yarns as an internal high strength layer, coupled with an external 'foldable' layer which could deform in a controlled way during the explosion, in a way similar to air-bags in cars.
