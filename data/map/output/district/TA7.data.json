In 2010, photovoltaic (PV) technology was the leading renewable energy technology in terms of capacity growth in Europe. But for reaching the main sectorial target: \u201cup to 15% of the EU electricity will be generated by solar energy in 2020\u201d it is a pre-requisite to achieve the substantial reduction of costs and the improvement of device efficiencies.\nRecent developments in PV worldwide business are showing that other global economies are fiercely fighting to take over EU leadership in the production of the PV products as well as technology. EU could maintain a competitive position due to introduction of new cost-effective photovoltaic technologies underpinned by strong RTD efforts allowing European companies to develop innovative knowledge intensive solutions through whole supply chain to capture market share.\nThe biggest influences on the cost effectiveness of the conversion of cells to modules are the optimisation of cell efficiency and material consumption and the optimisation of the combined module manufacturing and installation cost.\nThe proposed project aims to bring the innovative photovoltaic technology enabling achievement of 0,67 \u20ac/W cost target in next two years. To achieve this goal proposers will develop innovative concepts for key components of PV system, prototype and test the stationary low concentrating photovoltaic module of novel design. The proposed solutions enable higher conversion efficiency and 5-fold reduction of active material \u2013 both leading to significant cost/performance, resulting more than 20% reduction of the Watt-peak. By creating a non-competitive supply chain within the consortium the SME partners will be able to use the new technology developed to secure their competitive advantage in PV markets and over 10 year\u2019s period make a cumulative profit of about 27 M\u20ac.", 118540.0, 1343521.0, "SOLGAIN", "Cost-effective solar modules", "EU-funded scientists are developing innovative module designs for solar cell production to provide an important increase in cost performance.", "To decrease photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation costs, the solar energy industry was forced to implement innovative solutions for large-scale PV deployment. Enhancing cell energy conversion efficiency while decreasing its cost and using less active material will facilitate development of cost-effective modules.  \n\nThe EU-funded project 'Competitive stationary low concentrating solar module of novel design' (http://solgain.eu/ (SOLGAIN)) aimed to address these economic and technological hurdles. Scientists are developing and testing novel designs of key PV system components \u2014 stationary low-concentrating photovoltaic (LCPV) modules.   \n\nScientists completed the requirements and specifications for each stationary LCPV module component as well as module assembly. For instance, an LCPV with a prism-coupled compound parabola concentrator of wide acceptance angle will maximise annual energy production. A transparent dielectric nanocomposite material with high refractive index obviates the need for mechanical solar tracking in a fully stationary solar module. A high-efficiency back-side interdigitated copper contact solar cell will optimise performance, eliminate shading losses and cut down costs.  \n\nTo date, SOLGAIN developed a nanocomposite material with a refractive index of 1.9 and implemented the simulation model for designing the prism-coupled compound parabola concentrator. Furthermore, the team formulated a strategy for reaching approximately 20 % solar cell efficiency with back-side interdigitated copper contact and self-forming nanostructured antireflective coating.  \n\nSOLGAIN prototypes should enable higher conversion efficiencies and fivefold active material reduction \u2014 both leading to significant cost performance. This should help overcome current barriers to more widespread market uptake of PV technology and maintain competitive advantage in the energy sector.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/146970.jpg", "fp7_105027_971100466"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TA7"}
