They do not corrode; have a longer predicted service life, leading to less frequent replacement; they are less expensive to install due to their light weight and flexibility; and have significantly lower leakage rates due to having an all-welded system. However, their more widespread use is being restricted by the lack of a reliable non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method for the welded joints. Pipeline leakage does not only cause high repair costs but can also result in disastrous environmental consequences and even in loss of life. This project will develop phased array ultrasonic NDE procedures for butt fusion and electrofusion joints in PE pipes of diameters up to 1m and also for pipes in other plastics materials, including PVC, ABS, PP and PVDF. In addition, the project will also develop an automated inspection system that will be able to inspect pipe-to-pipe and pipe-to-fitting (elbows, bends, reducers, tees, etc) butt and socket joints in various plastic pipe materials and diameters between 90 and 1000mm. The development will be made by manufacturing welded joints containing known flaws. The NDE data will be analysed to determine the limits of flaw detection for each technique. In parallel, the significance of flaw size and quantity will be established in relation to service requirements. This will be achieved by long-term mechanical testing of joints containing known flaws, and comparison with results for welds containing no flaws. The prototype equipment, designed and built as part of this project will be assessed under both laboratory and field conditions.", 27073.0, 2841324.0, "TESTPEP", "Non-destructively testing plastic pipe welds", "Polyethylene (PE) has better resistance to chemicals and corrosion than metals. New ultrasonic non-destructive testing technology will enable easy and cost-effective pipe weld testing during manufacture, installation and beyond.", "PE is lightweight, has long predicted service life and leakage-resistant \u2014 all of which decrease installation and maintenance costs of piping, while reducing environmental hazards. Until now, testing the joints in PE pipes required weld removal for mechanical testing or visual inspection.\n\nThe EU-funded project http://www.testpep.eu/ (TESTPEP) developed an automated phased-array ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation (NDE) system. This enables the volumetric analysis of welds in PE pipes, either during production or retrospectively. The team successfully optimised all the main system components and characterised ultrasound propagation for both medium density and high density PE pipe materials.\n\nProcedures were then developed to insert planar flaws and particulate contamination into both butt fusion and electrofusion welds. Following this, numerous welds with variable flaws were manufactured to develop inspection procedures and flaw acceptance criteria, based on both short-term and long-term mechanical performance.\n\nResearchers designed and manufactured novel phased-array probes and different probe holders and attachment mechanisms for the modular scanning system. These are capable of inspecting welds in PE pipes of diameters ranging from 180 to 710 millimetres.\n\nAutomated software analyses the inspection data, generating a map of the weld and comparing results with acceptance criteria. The complete prototype phased array ultrasonic inspection system has been assessed in the laboratory, during manufacturing and in the field. In the assessment trials, the system successfully detected all major flaw types of interest to the European plastics pipes industry.\n\nTESTPEPs ultrasound-based NDE technology for welds in plastic piping fills a critical industry need for standardised flaw detection and acceptance criteria. Information about the project including brochures, magazine articles, conference papers and videos can be found in over 25 publications on the project\u2019s website. Commercialisation will reduce leaks, disruptions due to repairs and the environmental risks of catastrophic failures. Increasing confidence in the use of plastic piping will also enhance the competitive position of plastics\u2019 manufacturers.", null, "http://www.fullflow.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/146612.jpg", "fp7_94545_991819860"], ["3FF", "Ultrasonic Phased Array Non-Destructive Testing and In-Service Inspection System for high integrity Polyethylene Pipe Welds with automated analysis software.", "Plasflow Limited", "\u2022 The need arises from the greater use of PE pipes with a lower capital, installation, operation & maintenance cost and corrosion free during service but is limited through not having a suitable NDT technique to check the integrity of the welded joints between pipes\n\u2022 The objective is to take recently developed FP7 inspection/NDT technology for polyethylene (PE) pipe welds, from TRL6 to a TRL9 commercial product that will be exploited globally by the consortium partner providers to the consortium end user, Tier1/2 suppliers and other customers in the EU and globally by product sales and services. \n\u2022 Funds are requested from consortium members TWI, M2M, Plasflow, Tecnitest\n\u2022 \u20ac1.9m of funds is requested\n\u2022 The money will be used for the enhancement, meeting of specific application site testing requirements and the commercialisation of Ultrasonic Testing technology, software, technique validation, standards and technician training/certification.\n\u2022 Funds will enable the application specific product enhancements to be made and to support product/service/support commercialisation\n\u2022 Ultrasonic equipment, transducers, software suppliers and service inspection/NDT companies as well as end-user nuclear plant, gas/water utilities, mines will all benefit\n\u2022 Target market covers nuclear NPP, gas & water utilities, mining & process plant with a total size of 11.5billion welds.
