Some manufacturers make random checks on single components from batches of component lots. However, components especially the surface mount type are typically supplied on tape reels to assist with component feed for automatic component placement. The manufacturer cannot check all the components. Typically, a check includes visual inspection and in circuit testing. However, performing these checks is disadvantageous for two main reasons. Firstly, the tests can be time consuming and secondly it requires the component to be removed from the packaging or reel invalidating any guarantee to a claim should a counterfeit component be found. Currently, no automatic methods exist to speedily check each single component. In addition the cost of modern X-ray inspection systems prohibits their use for smaller manufacturing concerns. ChipCheck proposal is for the development of a novel X-ray inspection system for fast automated detection of counterfeit PCB components. The aim of such a development is to address the above issues. The system will be developed so that is capable of inspecting PCB components on tape reels and other component feeding mechanisms. In addition separate PCB components will also be examinable with the developed system. Through the selected combination of SME partners involved in the consortium, a new design uniquely combining lower cost off-the-shelf components used from different industries (Industrial NDT, Medical and dentistry) will be developed to enable production of a prototype of particular suitability for goods inward inspection.", 243763.0, 1266378.0, "CHIPCHECK", null, null, null, null, "http://www.cituk-online.com", null, "fp7_96181_998466009"], ["3JB", "High Energy Digital Radiography", "Computerised Information Technology Ltd", "The project objective is to develop digital computed radiography technology for the volumetric examination of large scale safety critical pressure components (e.g. pump bowls, valve bodies, thick section vessel and pipe welds) for the detection of in-service defects, the presence of which could lead in catastrophic component failure. Energy sector businesses (e.g. oil &amp;amp; gas, petrochemical and power generation - civil nuclear and fossil fuel) use processes that operate at high pressure and often high temperature. The engineering components used in such processes include for example, pipes, valves, turbine casings, pump bowls, catalytic crackers/reformers etc, all of which can be made of large section thick materials to withstand the severe pressure/temperature conditions under which they operate. All of these components can be prone to in-service failure resulting from material degradation mechanisms such as metal fatigue, creep and corrosion. Failure of such components could easily be catastrophic in terms of local and district fatalities/injuries and environmental /economic impact. There are approximately 700 refineries, 5000\\ chemical plants, 450 nuclear power stations and in excess of 3000 fossil fuelled power stations around the world. The trend is for the number of these plants to increase as the worlds developing countries will consumes ever increasing amounts of energy. Capital assets such as power stations, refineries and petrochemical plants usually generate revenues of typically \u20ac1 million/day. However, despite their strategic and critical applications and the dire \u2018consequences of component failure\u2019 (local and district safety hazard, environmental and economic), there are generally no economic, reliable Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques to volumetrically in-service examine critical thick section pressure retaining components that are vital to the plants continued safe operation.", 355292.0, 1304787.0, "HEDRAD", null, null, null, "http://www.hedrad.com", "http://www.cituk-online.com", null, "fp7_93297_998466009"], ["3JB", "An Intelligent On-line High-Speed Rail Condition Monitoring System Deployed Via Passenger and Freight Trains", "Computerised Information Technology Ltd", "Greener and more comfortable trains making rail transport a more attractive option for passengers in comparison to other means of transportation. The ever growing need for the society to employ more environmentally friendly transportation policies is expected to further underline the economic and societal role of rail transport in achieving sustainable mobility across Europe in the years to follow. Today, the European rail network is continuously getting busier with trains travelling at higher speeds and carrying more passengers and heavier axle loads than ever before. The combination of these factors has put considerable pressure on the existing infrastructure, leading to increased demands in inspection and maintenance of rail assets. Several infrastructure related accidents in the rail industry occur due to rail failure. The continuous increase in train traffic, axle loads and operating speeds means that the catastrophic failure of a rail section may result in severe derailments, such as the one that took place in Hatfield, UK, in 2000, causing loss of life, injuries, severe disruption in the operation of the network, unnecessary costs, and loss of confidence in rail transport by the public. I-RAIL seeks to practically eliminate rail failures by successfully delivering a non-contact high-speed rail condition monitoring system based on Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer technology. The application of the high-speed system will be complemented through the implementation of novel semi-automated testing equipment based on ultrasonic phased array technology which will be deployed for the in-situ verification and evaluation of the defects detected during high-speed inspection.

From a strict techno-economic aspect, the two CSP technologies which are currently commercially viable are those based on parabolic trough and Linear Fresnel Reflector designs. Parabolic trough concentrators are the most widely deployed type of solar thermal power plant. Most of the existing parabolic trough plants operate up to 400\u00b0C, but with recent technological advances the maximum operating temperature of newly commissioned plants can reach 550\u00b0C. Solar thermal power plants still face several technical problems related to the structural integrity and inspection of critical components such as the absorber tube and piping of the coolant system. It is currently impossible to inspect the absorber tube as it is located inside a glass envelope under vacuum. Moreover a significant proportion of the coolant system is insulated to minimise heat losses and therefore it cannot be inspected unless the insulation has been removed beforehand. One of the highest priorities for the European solar thermal energy industry is the significant improvement of the structural reliability of critical components of CSP plants. This should involve a solid reduction in inspection and maintenance costs mainly associated with unpredicted failures and leaks.\nINTERSOLAR seeks to decrease by a noticeable margin the number of failures associated with the coolant system and absorber tubes of CSP plants resulting in the minimisation of corrective maintenance costs.

The industry is therefore continuously aiming for increases in integrated circuit miniaturization, processor speeds and circuit densities. The resultant increasing numbers of ever finer features on the silicon chip, and the need to electrically connect to them has stretched conventional wired or leaded electronics interconnect technology to its limits. This trend of miniaturisation with higher functionality looks set to continue, requiring fundamental advances in device electrical interconnect and mounting technology. Ball Grid Arrays (BGAs) is a key technology that simultaneously addresses the requirements for high density fine feature electrical interconnect and physical attachment of silicon chip devices. BGA is a 2-D array of miniature solder alloy spheres under the silicon chip that provides both electrical connection and mechanical attachment to a mounting socket or circuit board. The small diameter of the solder alloy spheres reduces electrical resistance and capacitance and helps to preserve electrical signal integrity. BGA technology facilitates a reduction in the silicon chip package size, better heat dissipation, and greater module (circuit) densities. Typical mobile phones and laptops contain 3,000 and 6,000 BGAs respectively. These BGAs are inside CPU, RAM, DSP, Memory sticks, Consumer electronic etc. The \u03bcBGAS project aims at wider SME companies who are interested in the development of novel production techniques for producing \u03bcBGAs of less than 150\u03bcm.
