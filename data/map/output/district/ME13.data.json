This project specifically focuses on the application of magnetic cooling technology to the domestic refrigeration market. This is a technology being developed by SMEs but which will eventually be used by global appliance manufacturers. This proposal aims to enhance the collaboration between SMEs (such as Camfridge, PSUtec, Re-gent and IIR), global appliance manufacturers (such as Whirlpool) and draw on the expertise found in Universities and Research Centres (Politecnico di Milano and S.C.I.R.E.)\nMagnetic refrigeration uses solid refrigerants and so is gas free; in Europe this will remove iso-butane with a GWP of 3.3, but which is flammable; outside Europe it will remove HFCs with a GWP of 1000 or more.  Magnetic cooling is intended to be a cost effective solution for enabling the A\\\\\\ appliance; and when combined with the latest insulation it will enable the A\\\\\\\\ appliance, not yet defined in the EU standard.", 148525.0, 2425738.0, "ELICIT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.micropumps.co.uk", null, "fp7_111435_950904872"]]}}, "outwardCode": "ME13"}
