This project specifically focuses on the application of magnetic cooling technology to the domestic refrigeration market. This is a technology being developed by SMEs but which will eventually be used by global appliance manufacturers. This proposal aims to enhance the collaboration between SMEs (such as Camfridge, PSUtec, Re-gent and IIR), global appliance manufacturers (such as Whirlpool) and draw on the expertise found in Universities and Research Centres (Politecnico di Milano and S.C.I.R.E.)\nMagnetic refrigeration uses solid refrigerants and so is gas free; in Europe this will remove iso-butane with a GWP of 3.3, but which is flammable; outside Europe it will remove HFCs with a GWP of 1000 or more.

We have an integrated Autism unit and more students with special educational needs than the national average. OFSTED noted in one report that we have 'some of the lowest rates of pupils...from different ethnic and religious backgrounds'. This is a unique challenge, leaving our students at risk of poor social mobility and social exclusion. This has led us to work hard to develop the international ethos of the school which has led us to be nationally recognised for our work, a case study for the British Council and winning awards. We want to increase engagement, motivate students towards lifelong learning, and reduce the number of students truanting or at risk from early school leaving. To do this we intend to continue with our student mobility projects. We have also started offering the new International Baccalaureate Careers Programme level 3 qualification. This is in a bid to make our Sixth Form offer more attractive to students that do not want to take a traditional academic pathway, are unsure about what they want to do after year 11, or are not ready or unable to find an apprenticeship. It is hoped that this will help to prevent early-school leaving and equip our students for the global marketplace. We need staff to be engaged with this international work as it is a holistic package that requires close cross-curricular work and represents a culture shift from the traditional qualifications staff are currently familiar with.\r\n\r\nSummary of the objectives of the project:\r\n-Strengthen multi-cultural education\r\n-To develop resources that explore the international dimension \r\n-To develop a range of pedagogical techniques in order to adapt to the changing educational landscape\r\n-Exchange best practices and new teaching methods\r\n-Encourage the students\u2019 personal learning and thinking skills\r\n-Improve and develop skills in the use of ICT\r\n-Develop group work capabilities \r\n-Develop the entrepreneurial and employability skills \r\n-Broaden the use of interdisciplinary studies\r\n-Increase the motivation to learn foreign languages\r\n-Attempt to introduce CLIM (cooperative learning in multicultural groups) into teaching methods\r\n-To develop a range of techniques in order to deal with sensitive cultural issues\r\n-To develop a range of techniques in order to combat drop out rates and engage pupils at risk of early school leaving. \r\n-Emphasize independent and lifelong learning.\r\n-Develop the International Baccalaureate Careers Programme.\r\n-Become an IB World School\r\n-Develop the training courses we already have on offer, and create new courses to disseminate our learning to our local partner schools as part of the Swale Teaching Alliance.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\nUp to 27 members of staff that display the following through an application process - \r\n-Motivation and sensibility towards self development and implementing new and innovative methodology\r\n-Dedication to the aims, objectives and ambitions of the project\r\n-Ability and willingness to disseminate the experience and share best practice\r\n-A desire to gain experience, rejuvenate practice, address challenges, develop policy, become involved in the International Baccalaureate Careers Programme, or develop other curriculum or pastoral roles.\r\n\r\nDescription of Activities:\r\nWithin school there will be whole staff meetings, training courses workshops and one-to-one support meetings available. Mobility activities include:\r\n-International Baccalaureate specific subject and coordinator training,\r\n-Networking conferences\r\n-Pedagogical conferences on innovative education; entrepreneurship, increasing engagement, mentoring vulnerable students, sharing best practice, ICT, social and emotional skills, inclusive education and broadening student horizons.\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project:\r\nThis project focuses on external courses that meet the project aims. It focuses on dissemination to ensure that the member of staff that benefits from the initial training shares this with staff. This will be done through our already robust training programme, and our strong connection to the Swale Teaching Alliance and Canterbury Christ Church University.\r\n\r\nResults, impact and longer term benefits:\r\n-Increase in pedagogical knowledge\r\n-More innovative methodology observed\r\n-Active engagement in the international ethos, holistic development of students and reducing early school leaving\r\n-Knowledge of other curricular structures and policies to increase reflective and critical practice\r\n-Increase in sharing best practice and cross-curricular work\r\n-Less students leaving school without employment, training, or further education arrangements\r\n-A diverse, engaging curriculum offer that encourages lifelong learning\r\n-Motivated staff\r\n-IB World School status and the ability to share our experience with others\r\n-Rejuvenation for the local community due to the diverse training and experience of our students.", "http://www.abbeyschoolfaversham.co.uk", "The Abbey School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013175_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "ME13"}
