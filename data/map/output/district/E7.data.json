Currently many teachers at our school do not have formal French qualifications and lack the confidence and knowledge to successfully teach outstanding French lessons. Additionally, although our school has a strong international focus due to the diversity of pupils' backgrounds, we would like to have a stronger European focus. \r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this project is to improve the quality of French teaching. We believe that the opportunity to have intensive language lessons and sessions on MFL pedagogy will greatly increase the confidence of those participants who attend the course. Furthermore, practical opportunities to implement their acquired language skills through extra-curricular activities will boost participants' confidence and enthusiasm.  On return these staff will share the resources they have obtained and the skills they have learnt with other teachers in their year and Key Stage. The MFL Coordinator will share the results of the project at a school level as well as at a local and regional level (through Teach First conference presentations, Association for Language Learning regional meetings and through the Elmhurst Primary School's teaching school). A longer-term potential impact is that the MFL Coordinator would like to arrange a Newham Primary Languages Conference, which would partly consist of sharing the results of this project. This has the potential to impact many pupils in schools throughout the borough.\r\n\r\nThe second key objective is to enhance the inter-cultural awareness of staff and pupils at our school. Those staff who attend the course will gain a fantastic insight into French culture including the history of Lyon, the cuisine of the local area and education in France. Furthermore, we plan to involve other pupils and staff on this project through a pre-departure assembly, a blog and class activities researching the local area. In the long-term we aim to forge a successful partnership with a French primary school and to use our new expertise to plan linguistic and cross-curricular activities which will enhance the learning and cultural awareness of all pupils involved.", "http://www.elmhurstprimary.co.uk/", "Elmhurst Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036037_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["8QP", "RWK", "DAY HOSPITAL"], ["8QP", "RWK", "EAST HAM MEMORIAL HOSPITAL"], ["8QR", "RWK", "EAST HAM MEMORIAL HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "E7"}
