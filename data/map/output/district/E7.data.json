One of our teachers will participate in the project. She will improve her  language skills and develop a greater understanding of the Spanish culture which will enable  her to approach her Spanish lessons with more confidence and a readiness and enthusiasm to share her skills and knowledge with her classes, her department and the rest of the school community.  She will participate in 3 training courses  leading initially to DELE B1 and ultimately the DELE C1. The training will include developing listening, reading, writing and speaking skills, grammatical knowledge and an in depth understanding of Spanish culture and  traditions. The training will take place at a language school in Murcia in Spain where we have recently set up a link with a local school. \r\nFor the participating teacher results will include more extensive use of Spanish in the classroom and more encouragement of pupil use of the target language, the development of materials and resources bringing Spanish culture into the classroom and pupils in \r\nGCSE classes will be on track to achieve their target grades. The MFL department will benefit through CPD sessions during which the participating teacher will share the skills and knowledge gained during the training. The whole-school will benefit from having specialist teachers delivering GCSE Spanish and from the the development of cross curricular projects across a range of subject areas, in particular those not yet involved in projects with a  European Dimension.  Long-term we hope that the participating teacher will be able to deliver A level Spanish, that the experience of lifelong learning will inspire other teachers to participate in similar programmes and that the European dimension is extended to every subject area in the school through initiatives such as work experience in Europe.", "http://www.stbons.org", "St Bonaventure's School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012930_coordinator"], ["8JY", "Improving quality of French teaching through staff language training", "Elmhurst Primary School", 7553.0, "Elmhurst Primary School is applying for four teachers to take part in an LFEE Primary Immersion course in Lyon during the Easter holidays 2018. Currently many teachers at our school do not have formal French qualifications and lack the confidence and knowledge to successfully teach outstanding French lessons. Additionally, although our school has a strong international focus due to the diversity of pupils' backgrounds, we would like to have a stronger European focus. \r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this project is to improve the quality of French teaching. We believe that the opportunity to have intensive language lessons and sessions on MFL pedagogy will greatly increase the confidence of those participants who attend the course. Furthermore, practical opportunities to implement their acquired language skills through extra-curricular activities will boost participants' confidence and enthusiasm.  On return these staff will share the resources they have obtained and the skills they have learnt with other teachers in their year and Key Stage. The MFL Coordinator will share the results of the project at a school level as well as at a local and regional level (through Teach First conference presentations, Association for Language Learning regional meetings and through the Elmhurst Primary School's teaching school). A longer-term potential impact is that the MFL Coordinator would like to arrange a Newham Primary Languages Conference, which would partly consist of sharing the results of this project. This has the potential to impact many pupils in schools throughout the borough.\r\n\r\nThe second key objective is to enhance the inter-cultural awareness of staff and pupils at our school. Those staff who attend the course will gain a fantastic insight into French culture including the history of Lyon, the cuisine of the local area and education in France. Furthermore, we plan to involve other pupils and staff on this project through a pre-departure assembly, a blog and class activities researching the local area. In the long-term we aim to forge a successful partnership with a French primary school and to use our new expertise to plan linguistic and cross-curricular activities which will enhance the learning and cultural awareness of all pupils involved.", "http://www.elmhurstprimary.co.uk/", "Elmhurst Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036037_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "E7"}
