A phased approach will link experienced cities and new cities in partnerships, greatly facilitating the smooth introduction of the new systems now and into the future. Using this arrangement the project will be linked to other projects fully funded from other sources and therefore magnifies the impact of the JTI.\n\nIn the context of the H2FC bus projects and progress achieved to this point, the expected results of CHIC will take the technology to the brink of commercialisation, leading in turn to very significant environmental & economic benefits to Europe and to the World.", null, 66989116.0, "CHIC", null, null, null, null, "http://www.the-wright-group.com", null, "fp7_97944_990677976"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT42"}
