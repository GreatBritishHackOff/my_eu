Thanks to controlled generation mechanisms, the user can then steer the machine to generate content that fits with their intentions.

MIR has reached a state of maturity where there are standard methods for most music information processing tasks, but as these have been developed and tested on small datasets, the methods tend to be neither robust to different musical styles or use contexts, nor scalable to industrial scale datasets. To address this need, and to train a new generation of researchers who are aware of, and can tackle, these challenges, we bring together leading MIR groups and a wide range of industrial and cultural stakeholders to create a multidisciplinary, transnational and cross-sectoral European Training Network for MIR researchers, in order to contribute to Europe's leading role in this field of scientific innovation, and accelerate the impact of innovation on European products and industry.\n\nThe researchers will develop breadth in the fields that make up MIR and in transferable skills, whilst gaining deep knowledge and skills in their own area of speciality. They will learn to perform collaborative research, and to think entrepreneurially and exploit their research in new ways that benefit European industry and society.\n\nThe proposed work is structured along three research frontiers identified as requiring intensive attention and integration (data-driven, knowledge-driven, and user-driven approaches), and will be guided by and grounded in real application needs by a unique set of industrial and cultural stakeholders in the consortium, which range from consumer electronics companies and big players in media entertainment to innovative SMEs, cultural institutions, and even a famous opera house, thus encompassing a very wide spectrum of the digital music world.", 228966.0, 3420161.0, "MIP-Frontiers", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_211692_960670347"], ["0XP", "BIOfilm management and CLEANing by leveraging fundamental understanding of biological, chemical and physical combined approaches", "Procter & Gamble Technical Centres Limited", "BIOCLEAN addresses the urgent need to create a sustainable training network across academia, industry and the healthcare sector which will fill the gap in Europe and beyond to produce highly skilled multi-disciplinary young scientists competent in chemistry, engineering and experimental wet lab biology.

However, there is a growing activity in the so-called music synchronization business: music composed, retrieved, or otherwise produced to fit with the many constraints of videos, movies, games or commercials. Synchronized music has to satisfy complex constraints, specified temporally (specific events at specific moments, or, in the case of interactive music, specific moods matching the player\u2019s situation, etc.). Major movie, game and advertisement companies devote considerable budgets to get synchronized music by famous artists. Producing such synchronized music is a costly process currently performed manually by well-known artists or specialized studios. This results in prohibitive costs for high-quality synchronized music, that only a few professional customers can afford.\nThe commercial value of synchronized music lies in the style of the composer. Style is what makes an artist\u2019s music easily recognizable: Paul McCartney has a unique composition style, Joao Gilberto has a distinctive guitar accompaniment style, and Take 6 are well known for their incomparable harmonization style. Producing operational representations of style is precisely the subject matter of the ERC project Flow-machines, which already produced scientific and technical breakthroughs: turning style into a new content type is within reach. The next step is to explore commercial strategies to exploit style. \nThe goal of this PoC project is to apply these techniques to synchronized music, and to study three business models in the movie, game and advertisement sectors. The project will: 1) develop a style manipulation prototype for synchronized music, 2) evaluate the prototype in the key industrial sectors and 3) clear legal issues related to the exploitation of style information.", null, 119773.0, "FlowMachines", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_193789_960670347"], ["0NY", "An innovative people localisation system for safe evacuation of large passenger ships", "Rcl Cruises Ltd", "Maritime disasters in recent years are a stark reminder of the imperative need for timely and effective evacuation of large passenger ships during emergency.
