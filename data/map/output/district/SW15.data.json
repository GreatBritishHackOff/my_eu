The water in the system pipes is stagnant and, if inhibitors are inactive, then this can give rise to microbiological induced corrosion (MIC), which leads to leaks. This corrosion is localised and is not evident in close visual inspection until the leak starts. Moreover the pipes are often enclosed and difficult to access for close viewing. MIC may occur in both dry and wet sprinkler systems.\nLong range ultrasonic testing (LRUT) has been developed for screening long lengths of pipe (up to 100m from one test location) for corrosion, especially in otherwise inaccessible areas. It has been used to a limited extent on the feeder pipes and risers in sprinkler systems. However, the pipe lengths are too short (typically <5m) and the defects too small in comparison with the ultrasound wavelengths for current LRUT systems.

An E-Hub is a physical cross point, similar to an energy station, in which energy and information streams are interconnected, and where the different forms of energy can be converted into each other and/or can be stored. The E-hub exchanges energy via the energy grids between the different actors (e.g. households, renewable energy plants, offices), who may be a consumer at one time, and a supplier at another time. The consumers and suppliers exchange information on their energy needs and energy production with the energy hub, the hub then distributes the energy available in the most efficient way.

The consumers and suppliers should be connected to this E-hub by means of bi-directional energy grids (low and/or high temperature heat grid, cold grid for cooling, electrical grid (AC and/or DC), gas grid (H2, biogas, syngas).

Collaborative research with state-of-the art technologies from multiple disciplines (hydrology, ecology, microbiology, engineering, environmental physics, contaminant science, modelling) will generate new mechanistic insights into the functioning of HZs. A group of ESRs will be educated using the multi-faceted nature of HZs as the central theme of the training programme. The supra-disciplinary expertise within the network and the high-level training program will generate scientific knowledge that will set the ground for a more holistic design of river management plans and restoration measures. Research excellence as well as scientific and technological innovation is ensured as all partners have world-leading reputations and work at the forefront of their respective discipline areas.\n\nParticipating in HypoTRAIN will make ESRs highly attractive for employers and open up doors for their successful careers in research, regulation, consulting, and industry. They will be experts for the better assessment of the ecological and chemical status of surface waters and for providing successful river restoration and management strategies. The strong involvement of the non-academic sector will provide the ESRs with a holistic perspective on career opportunities.", 224574.0, 2539990.0, "HypoTRAIN", null, null, null, null, "http://www.roehampton.ac.uk", null, "h2020_193864_994336040"], ["5PJ", "Our Mythical Childhood...

This newly identified research field offers valuable insights into the processes leading to the formation of the culture recipients\u2019 identities along with their initiation into adulthood. However, the most vital potential of this phenomenon remains unexploited, for the research is still selective, focused mainly on Western culture. With my project, I intend to overcome these limitations by applying regional perspectives without the pejorative implication of regional as parochial or inferior. I recognize regions as extremely valuable contexts of the reception of Antiquity, which is not only passively taken in, but also actively reshaped in children\u2019s and young adults\u2019 culture in response to regional and global challenges. Thus, the essence of this innovative approach consists in comparative studies of differing reception models not only across Europe but also America, Australia & New Zealand and \u2013 a bold but necessary step \u2013 in parts of the world not commonly associated with Graeco-Roman tradition: Africa and Asia. The shared heritage of Classical Antiquity, recently enhanced by the global influence of popular culture (movies, Internet activities, computer games inspired by the classical tradition), gives a unique opportunity \u2013 through the reception filter \u2013 to gain deeper understanding of the key social, political and cultural transformations underway at various locations. The added value of this original research, carried out by an international team of scholars, will be its extremely broad impact on the frontiers of scholarship, education and culture: we will elaborate a supra-regional survey of classical references, publish a number of analyses of crucial reception cases, and prepare materials on how to use ancient myths in work with disabled children, thus contributing to integration and stimulating cultural exchange.", 224243.0, 1298379.0, "OurMythicalChildhood", null, null, null, null, "http://www.roehampton.ac.uk", null, "h2020_205179_994336040"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5PJ", "FRED AT SCHOOL", "ROEHAMPTON UNIVERSITY LBG", 152892.0, "FRED AT SCHOOL is a project aimed at building new audiences and raising awareness of European films among secondary school students (aged 14-16).It will take place in all EU countries, in all EU languages.It will be conducted via screenings in schools, supported by the radio, which will be used as a new way to promote film literacy in all European languages.Students will also be involved in the creation of radio content, in their own native language and in English.The focus of the project, therefore, is not only film literacy, but also training in effective film radio communication.It is an innovative approach to film education, and a fresh approach to building audiences and expanding the audience's choices.

Similar schools can only be found beyond our borders, because there is a lack of such schools in Slovenia.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we have three different groups of participants, first group of participants will observe at workplace - job shadowing, other target group consists of  teachers, assistants, and they will try a new challenge - how to teach autistic kids at a partner school, a third group of participants will attend seminars and last group will learn about support centre acitvities. For each area of development, we found a partner with which we will develop  our priority fields. Our areas are: new knowledge in the field of assistants for autism in elementary school, new methods and forms of work with children with autism, new knowledge in the field of speech methods in primary school and kindergarten, knowledge of the school sign language interpreters, new knowledge in the field of residential units for primary school children and knowledge about support center strategies with deaf children. In special school with a kindergarten in the UK we will gain experience in the field of autism, on seminar which is taylor made for our group.  Two teachers will also have the opportunity to teach autistic children. By visiting the schools in Slovakia and Czech Republic we will focus on speech therapy and pedagogy and in Great Britain we will focus on the innovative aspects of supporting children who are deaf - especially in early years. In Azores we will visit inclusive school with deaf. We plan job shadowing for 2 deaf participants with interpreter. Seminar in Italy will be  mailny prepared for to school interpreters and teachers of deaf. \r\nWe plan to carefully manage the project in all its phases, with an emphasis on the preparation of all participants, the dissemination which starst on the first day of the project and lasts after the end of our project. Dissemination starts in our own organization, and will be expanded through time in the Slovenian schools, and with a help of a broad network even to other European organizations, especially to our partners organizations in other KA1 and KA2 projects.  A wide range of interested stakeholders will be reached with our articles, and the results will be published at the national and European platforms: EACEA, School Education Gateway, Geneva (Special Needs),  Moodle, blog and website of Special Skills project. All participants will be active in eTwinning, for which we will also educate them within this project. We  are going to evaluate all phases of the project, because our goal is the continuous improvement of our work in Erasmus +, all our activities will be monitored with a help of  the electronic evaluation forms.\r\nThe project, which addresses the objectives of the program and objectives of the Europa 2020 will also maintain its sustainability through a seminar  Erasmus+ in schools and kindergartens. A range of materials  will also be accessible on Moodle to all people interested.\r\n\r\nThe project Special Skills 2017 is extremely valuable for Ljubljana School for the Deaf  because it allows our teachers professional networking in Europe and with constant work in Erasmus+ also contributes to development of special field pedagogy in Europe.", "http://www.paddock.wandsworth.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SI01-KA101-035362_7"], ["5JQ", "LTA Apprenticeship Enhancement and European Progression", "LTA Operations Limited", 47932.0, "CONTEXT\r\n\r\nThe Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) is the governing body for tennis in the UK with the primary aim of growing and sustaining the sport by increasing participation and giving opportunities for high performance players to develop. It is committed to lifting the performance and quality of tennis at senior level and one of the key ways that is seeks to achieve this is through the Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (AASE) programme. AASE is a unique sporting vocational qualification for young people who have the realistic potential to achieve excellence in their sport by competing professionally or on the world stage. The programme combines a flexible education programme with a structured national training and development route across all sports, while preparing athletes for a career after sport.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to further enhance and improve the vocational training and development of Apprentices on the LTA AASE programme. This will be achieved via 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1) Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the LTA AASE programme, the LTA AASE Apprentices and the wider UK Tennis practices.\r\n\r\n2) Exposing LTA Apprentices to the European opportunities in both tennis and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n3) Embedding lifelong learning principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip Apprentices with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nParticipants will be selected from the circa 260 Apprentices that will form part of the LTA AASE programme in the 2017/2018 academic year, of which approximately 65% are male, 35% female and 23% from Black or Minority Ethnic groups.\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe majority of the project activities will take place at the BTT facility, including:\r\n\r\n- Regular training sessions with BTT coaches to address the defined sports performance targets. \r\n- Games versus high quality Spanish youth players.\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\nParticipants will also undertake a structured schedule of social/cultural activities, including:\r\n\r\n- A guided tour of Real Club de Tenis Barcelona (the oldest tennis club in Spain).\r\n- A visit to Barcelona.\r\n- Visits to the homes of BTT players\u2019 families, and other social events within the local community, providing unique social/cultural experiences and the opportunity to practice language skills.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLGY\r\n\r\nThe LTA will use the principles of the European Quality Charter for Mobility to set goals and define tasks for the key elements of the project:\r\n\r\n1) INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE: production of clear and accessible resources.\r\n2) LEARNING PLAN: clearly defining the project objectives and the role of each partner in achieving them.\r\n3) PERSONALISATION: pre-visit assessment of participants' desired learning outcomes.\r\n4) PREPARATION: a structured preparation programme tailored to individual needs.\r\n5) LANGUAGE: provision of formal and informal language training.\r\n6) LOGISTICS: a formal contract to be signed by both parties outlining practical and logistical responsibilities.\r\n7) MENTORING: provision of suitably qualified staff to facilitate achievement of individual goals and ensure integration.\r\n8) RECOGNITION: delivery of formal instruments to recognise individual learning outcomes.\r\n9) EVALUATION: comprehensive and objective evaluation of all aspects of the project.\r\n10) RESPONSIBILITIES: agreement by all parties on their roles and responsibilities in the successful delivery of the project, formalised in writing via a Memorandum of Understanding and individual participant Learning Plans. \r\n\r\nIMPACTS\r\n\r\nThe impacts on participants are expected to include:\r\n- Achievement of recognised vocational qualifications.\r\n- Development of life skills and experience that can be utilised throughout participants' education and careers.\r\n- Enhanced cultural and linguistic skills, facilitating openness to new opportunities both in the UK and Europe.\r\n- Improved knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in sport and other careers.\r\n\r\nThe impacts on the LTA are expected to include:\r\n- Enhancement of the LTA AASE programme both in terms of improved technical sporting quality of Apprentices and coaches, and also Apprentice achievement rates. \r\n- Implementation of best practice across the LTA AASE programme and also the organisation's wider education activities.\r\n- Improved exit and progression opportunities for Apprentices, both within sport and outside of it, and in the UK and Europe.", "http://www.lta.org.uk", "LTA Operations Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036038_coordinator"], ["5PJ", "Choreomundus - International Master in Dance Knowledge, Practice and Heritage (acronym: Choreomundus)", "ROEHAMPTON UNIVERSITY LBG", 2682958.0, "Choreomundus investigates dance and other movement systems (ritual practices, martial arts, games and physical theatre) as Intangible Cultural Heritage within the broader contexts of Ethnochoreology, the Anthropology of Dance, Dance Studies, and Heritage Studies.The programme is offered by a consortium of four universities internationally recognised for their leadership in the development of innovative curricula for the analysis of dance and other movement practices: University of Clermont Auvergne (UCA), Clermont-Ferrand, France; Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway; University of Szeged (SZTE), Hungary; University of Roehampton, London (URL), United Kingdom. Choreomundus focuses on fieldwork and formal analysis of movement, and engages with a variety of theoretical and methodological frameworks. The programme provides practical skills to observe, analyse, document, and evaluate dances, thereby developing an appreciation of dance that is comparative, cross-cultural, applied, and embodied. It equips students to make sense of intangible heritage within a culturally diverse world, to promote culturally appropriate modes of knowledge transmission, and to engage with cultural differences and problems of social exclusion in the 21st century. Employment opportunities exist worldwide within public and private organisations responsible for the safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) and within higher education and research. The production of digitised inventories of ICH for archival purposes or development of computer animation from motion capture data are some areas in which Choreomundus skills are required.
