The water in the system pipes is stagnant and, if inhibitors are inactive, then this can give rise to microbiological induced corrosion (MIC), which leads to leaks. This corrosion is localised and is not evident in close visual inspection until the leak starts. Moreover the pipes are often enclosed and difficult to access for close viewing. MIC may occur in both dry and wet sprinkler systems.\nLong range ultrasonic testing (LRUT) has been developed for screening long lengths of pipe (up to 100m from one test location) for corrosion, especially in otherwise inaccessible areas. It has been used to a limited extent on the feeder pipes and risers in sprinkler systems. However, the pipe lengths are too short (typically <5m) and the defects too small in comparison with the ultrasound wavelengths for current LRUT systems.

An E-Hub is a physical cross point, similar to an energy station, in which energy and information streams are interconnected, and where the different forms of energy can be converted into each other and/or can be stored. The E-hub exchanges energy via the energy grids between the different actors (e.g. households, renewable energy plants, offices), who may be a consumer at one time, and a supplier at another time. The consumers and suppliers exchange information on their energy needs and energy production with the energy hub, the hub then distributes the energy available in the most efficient way.

The consumers and suppliers should be connected to this E-hub by means of bi-directional energy grids (low and/or high temperature heat grid, cold grid for cooling, electrical grid (AC and/or DC), gas grid (H2, biogas, syngas).

Collaborative research with state-of-the art technologies from multiple disciplines (hydrology, ecology, microbiology, engineering, environmental physics, contaminant science, modelling) will generate new mechanistic insights into the functioning of HZs. A group of ESRs will be educated using the multi-faceted nature of HZs as the central theme of the training programme. The supra-disciplinary expertise within the network and the high-level training program will generate scientific knowledge that will set the ground for a more holistic design of river management plans and restoration measures. Research excellence as well as scientific and technological innovation is ensured as all partners have world-leading reputations and work at the forefront of their respective discipline areas.\n\nParticipating in HypoTRAIN will make ESRs highly attractive for employers and open up doors for their successful careers in research, regulation, consulting, and industry. They will be experts for the better assessment of the ecological and chemical status of surface waters and for providing successful river restoration and management strategies. The strong involvement of the non-academic sector will provide the ESRs with a holistic perspective on career opportunities.", 224574.0, 2539990.0, "HypoTRAIN", null, null, null, null, "http://www.roehampton.ac.uk", null, "h2020_193864_994336040"], ["5PJ", "Our Mythical Childhood... The Reception of Classical Antiquity in Children\u2019s and Young Adults\u2019 Culture in Response to Regional and Global Challenges", "Roehampton University", "The project aims at developing a pioneering approach to the reception of Classical Antiquity in children\u2019s and young adults\u2019 contemporary culture. This newly identified research field offers valuable insights into the processes leading to the formation of the culture recipients\u2019 identities along with their initiation into adulthood. However, the most vital potential of this phenomenon remains unexploited, for the research is still selective, focused mainly on Western culture. With my project, I intend to overcome these limitations by applying regional perspectives without the pejorative implication of regional as parochial or inferior. I recognize regions as extremely valuable contexts of the reception of Antiquity, which is not only passively taken in, but also actively reshaped in children\u2019s and young adults\u2019 culture in response to regional and global challenges. Thus, the essence of this innovative approach consists in comparative studies of differing reception models not only across Europe but also America, Australia & New Zealand and \u2013 a bold but necessary step \u2013 in parts of the world not commonly associated with Graeco-Roman tradition: Africa and Asia. The shared heritage of Classical Antiquity, recently enhanced by the global influence of popular culture (movies, Internet activities, computer games inspired by the classical tradition), gives a unique opportunity \u2013 through the reception filter \u2013 to gain deeper understanding of the key social, political and cultural transformations underway at various locations. The added value of this original research, carried out by an international team of scholars, will be its extremely broad impact on the frontiers of scholarship, education and culture: we will elaborate a supra-regional survey of classical references, publish a number of analyses of crucial reception cases, and prepare materials on how to use ancient myths in work with disabled children, thus contributing to integration and stimulating cultural exchange.", 224243.0, 1298379.0, "OurMythicalChildhood", null, null, null, null, "http://www.roehampton.ac.uk", null, "h2020_205179_994336040"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5PJ", "FRED AT SCHOOL", "ROEHAMPTON UNIVERSITY LBG", 152892.0, "FRED AT SCHOOL is a project aimed at building new audiences and raising awareness of European films among secondary school students (aged 14-16).It will take place in all EU countries, in all EU languages.It will be conducted via screenings in schools, supported by the radio, which will be used as a new way to promote film literacy in all European languages.Students will also be involved in the creation of radio content, in their own native language and in English.The focus of the project, therefore, is not only film literacy, but also training in effective film radio communication.It is an innovative approach to film education, and a fresh approach to building audiences and expanding the audience's choices. FRED will produce a radio program for each school. Such programs will be broadcast on the FRED channel corresponding to the students\u2019 language, and will also be available in podcast for all listeners.The radio broadcasting educational contents will extend film literacy to everyone interested, going beyond the schools themselves - this is why the project itself offers great added value. The project will include a final conference to present the results in the different countries and verify the level achieved in film literacy. Such event will be of interest to all the players in the film industry.Moreover, accessible versions of films aimed at students with hearing and visual impairment will be produced. Following the principles of accessible filmmaking, promoted by the United Nations-Accessibility Focus Group, the films will be made accessible in collaboration with the filmmakers in order to ensure that their vision is maintained in the accessible versions, and to raise awareness amongst filmmakers of the importance of audiovisual accessibility for hearing- and visually-impaired audiences.Thanks to FRED\u2019s project, sensory disable students will have the chance to see the films with the other students in the classroom in a totally inclusive experience.", null, "EMERALD CLEAR LIMITED", "creative_553981-CREA-1-2014-1-UK-MED-AUDEV_11"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["5PJ", "ROEHAMPTON UNIVERSITY LBG*RU", 34481.0, "Erasmus+ \u2014 Contribution from the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) (22.04.20)", "fts_2016_30696", 2016], ["5PJ", "ROEHAMPTON UNIVERSITY LBG*RU", 22988.0, "Contribution to Erasmus+ (22.02.04.02)", "fts_2016_35096", 2016], ["5PJ", "ROEHAMPTON UNIVERSITY LBG*RU", 258994.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2016_35216", 2016], ["5PJ", "ROEHAMPTON UNIVERSITY LBG*RU", 190795.0, "Erasmus+ \u2014 Contribution from the development cooperation instrument (DCI) (21.02.20)", "fts_2016_38561", 2016], ["5PJ", "ROEHAMPTON UNIVERSITY LBG*RU", 33645.0, "Erasmus+ \u2014 Contribution from the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) (22.04.20)", "fts_2017_25527", 2017], ["5PJ", "ROEHAMPTON UNIVERSITY LBG*RU", 287843.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_35524", 2017], ["5PJ", "ROEHAMPTON UNIVERSITY LBG*RU", 170961.0, "Erasmus+ \u2014 Contribution from the development cooperation instrument (DCI) (21.02.20)", "fts_2017_40782", 2017], ["5PJ", "ROEHAMPTON UNIVERSITY LBG*RU", 160019.0, "Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions \u2014 generating, developing and transferring new skills, knowledge and innovation (15.03.01.01)", "fts_2017_41495", 2017], ["5PJ", "ROEHAMPTON UNIVERSITY LBG*RU", 42740.0, "Erasmus+ \u2014 Contribution from the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) (22.04.20)", "fts_2017_58746", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "SW15"}
