The general objective is to explore novel and innovative (precompetitive) routes for transformation of natural gas to liquid products, particularly suited for remote areas to facilitate the transport. The aim is an integrated multi-disciplinary approach to develop in a long term vision the next-stage catalysts and related precompetitive technologies for gas to liquid conversion,  in fully consistence with the indications of the call. For this reason, we have excluded to consider as part of the project catalytic technologies, such as FT synthesis and hydrocracking. In addition, we have excluded to investigate coal to liquid, both due to environmental impact of the use of coal, and to focus R&D. We have thus focused the project on three cluster lines: 1.  new, not conventional routes for catalytic syngas formation from natural gas which include steps of separation by membrane and eventual reuse of byproducts; 2. direct catalytic conversion of methane to methanol/DME; 3. direct catalytic conversion of methane to aromatics under non-oxidative conditions followed by upgrading of the products by alkylation with ethane/propane.", 72700.0, 10388555.0, "NEXT-GTL", "Making better use of natural gas", "The conversion of natural gas to liquid fuel is a promising way to relieve dependence on decreasing fossil fuel reserves.

Scientists working on the EU-funded project 'Innovative catalytic technologies and materials for next gas to liquid processes' (NEXT-GTL) are addressing the main cost and technical challenges associated with conventional gas-to-liquid (GTL) processes.\n\nThey are exploring novel routes for catalytic syngas production from natural gas. They are also investigating direct catalytic conversion (without the syngas intermediary) of methane to methanol/dimethyl ether (DME) and to aromatic compounds \u2013 organic molecules having one or more six-carbon rings such as benzene.\n\nIn order to reduce the costs associated with syngas production, scientists have developed a novel and advanced multi-stage process. This exploits catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of natural gas together with gas separation membranes. Developed catalysts and membranes will be tested in a pilot plant facility for comparison with semi-commercial ones.\n\nEliminating the syngas production step is another promising route to decreased production costs of liquid transportable fuels, both gasoline and diesel. Scientists are exploring routes for direct, low-temperature catalytic conversion of methane into methanol with extensive investigation of suitable methane activation sites.\n\nIn addition, they are investigating direct catalytic conversion of methane to aromatics that can be upgraded (by chemically combining with ethane or propane in a so-called alkylation reaction). During the present reporting period, scientists have made important progress in novel active and stable catalyst development, both for aromatisation of methane and for benzene alkylation. They are also developing selectively permeable separation membranes to be used in both processes.\n\nNEXT-GTL is making important progress in developing novel cost-effective and efficient methods for catalytic conversion of methane to liquid fuels for the transportation sector.
