However, the take-up of simulation software by SMEs has until now been low due to high barriers of entry that include hardware prices, licensing costs and technical expertise. The CloudSME project will develop a cloud-based, one-stop-shop solution that will significantly lower these barriers, provide a scalable platform for small or larger scale simulations, and enable the wider take-up of simulation technologies in manufacturing and engineering SME's. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will support end user SME's to utilise customised simulation applications in the form of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based provision. Moreover, simulation software service providers and consulting companies will have access to a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that enables them to quickly assemble custom simulation solutions in the cloud for their clients. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will be built on existing and proven technologies provided by the project partners and partially developed in previous European projects. Building on existing technology will enable the project to deliver its results quickly. The project consortium includes experienced partners, incorporating 12 SME's, from cloud hardware and platform providers, to simulation software providers, end users and technology integrators. To guarantee greater impact of the developed solution, additional use-cases will be provided by a further 10 partners following an open call after the first year of the project. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will dramatically change the way in which manufacturing/engineering SME's utilise simulation solutions today, and will provide new business opportunities not only to end-user SME's, but also to simulation software and cloud service providers.A typical experimental scenario in the project is based around an insole design simulation program developed by one of the partners, used for designing tailored insoles for sports footwear and for people with foot problems. The end user company in the project has patented a method for scanning feet in 3D and the experiment will involve linking this to a cloud-based version of the simulation software to design insoles and simulate the interaction of feet and insoles. In turn, this design is loaded into a CNC machine to manufacture the insoles. The aim of the cooperation is to establish a portal through which scans can be uploaded to the cloud-based software service which then validates the scanned image to produce the design. The experiment will explore the extent to which the service supporting the lifecycle of tailored insole production can be achieved. This will immediately lead to extensions of the software for checking images within other industries unrelated to the footwear business.", 30216.0, 4193116.0, "CloudSME", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_109223_938275181"], ["4JF", "Avoiding and mitigating safety risks in urban environments", "London Borough of Waltham Forest", "The main objective of the City.Risks project is to increase the perception of security of citizens in cities by activating in a more transparent and sustainable way their participation in communities, through which information and interventions can be provided both to proactively protect citizens from falling victims to criminal activities as well as to reactively provide more timely and effective response and assistance.

We recognised the importance of real outcomes and transferable life skills and began to look into a more project based and cross curricular approach to facilitating learning.  We wanted our students to be independent and responsible learners who are less reliant on their teachers as providers of knowledge and have the skills to research, problem solve, persevere and collaborate.  With this in mind, we embarked on our first real project combining art, maths, English and computing with the overarching theme of Identity.  The project not only aimed to deliver the curriculum in these areas but to enhance enjoyment and engagement, to add meaning, to build skills and to provide an additional purpose.  The result of the students' work was a public exhibition, organised by students, which also acted as a fundraiser for our link school in Pakistan.  The project required huge commitment from the staff who volunteered to take part but the resulting passion, enjoyment and collaboration made it all worth it.  In addition, and more importantly, the students' focus and enjoyment was greatly heightened.  In fact, it created a real buzz around school.\r\n\r\nWe have also been driving forward our global identity within school and have successfully raised the profile through many means including: assemblies, partnership curriculum projects, Google Community with Dominica, our international clock wall and tutor time activities.\r\n\r\nWe have recently successfully achieved our re-accrediation for the International School Award. \r\n\r\nOur GREEN vision and international ethos has already formed part of our School Improvement Plan (SIP) and we are now ready to take this to the next level.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind along with current curriculum changes and our ever changing world, we want to ensure that our students receive the best possible learning experience.  This experience should not only ensure maximum progress, but also build skills that will be paramount for success in life beyond school.  A further impact of this being on a staff body who are challenged and passionate and provided a constant opportunity to develop their skills and explore new and innovative ways of facilitating learning.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Headteacher and the Teaching & Learning Leader also visited local schools and the Innovation Centre where they started to learn more about how new models of delivering the curriculum may look.  However, this does mean some quite significant changes and the need for seeing this in action in different ways is vital.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to providing a more inspiring and exciting curriculum to our students and to acting as a pioneer school in this area.  We want to learn from colleagues in countries where the education is already forward thinking with a project based and real life approach as we know that their expertise is incredibly valuable.\r\n\r\nOur aims and areas or improvements are clear to us, although we also understand that we muct be adaptable throughout this process and be open to a shift in these.  As outlined above we wish to: implement a cross curricular and project based curriculum, ensure MFL is at the heart of learning, enable teachers to take on a more facilitative role, support staff development, build our GREEN skills and values in staff and students, ensure that exciting and effective softwares enhance the learning experience.\r\n\r\nThere are key activities in order for this project to be effective: job shadowing/school visits and targeted training courses in identified areas.\r\nFor this project to be successful and to have sustained impact, our in school work will be well planned and thoroughly monitored.  Staff taking place will be carefully and fairly selected, they will be well prepped for the project and will be expected to create a report for sharing.\r\nAs a school, we will facilitate vital professional conversations and training in order to move us forward.\r\n\r\nOur new KS3 curriculum will form the bais for our new School Improvement Plan (SIP) which spans a three year period.

Comprehensive care, social support and community treatment outside of mental health institutions, as demonstrated by decades of empirical research on treatment results significantly contribute to better life quality and recovery. According to the National Strategy for the Development of Mental Health of the Republic of Serbia (2007.), in the past years the number of people suffering from mental health problems has been increasing as a result of the accumulated stress originated from impoverishment, wars and overall decaying life standards. People with mental health problems represent a social group on which society has plenty of misconceptions and little information. Prejudice, stereotypical representations, and fear originated by lack of information and experience with this vulnerable group are the result of insufficient interest on the part of the public, often resulting in discrimination against them. Taking in consideration the fact that only in the last few years we managed to slightly raise public awareness on this subject, and that prejudice and discrimination both by public and professionals, are very present and strong, mostly due to the lack of information and education on the subject, organization of education is of crucial importance in this phase of de-institutionalisation of mental health system. Only in the last 2 years some interest came from the EU, some small steps were taken toward improvement of situation, through the process of de-institutionalisation, reform in psychiatric system that includes transition from strictly institutional and medical treatment toward community initiatives, development of community services and centers for mental health, global change of attitudes toward psychiatric care users, change of practices and old fashion methods rooted in Serbian system of mental health. Hearing Voices, apart from being an alternative tool in the treatment and the new path in contemporary psychiatry practice in the world, also represents one of the most active contemporary tendencies in the fight for human rights of this population. Prostor has been working towards development of community based services and de-stigmatization of this population in Serbia since 2010, developing the Community Mental Health model. It is an official representative of the International Hearing Voices Network and one of the founders of the regional West Balkan HV Network.

During the stay in London, Mind in Camden will organize a 4-day training for Prostor staff, aiming to transfer following knowledge: advanced group facilitation based on Hearing Voices methods, organization of educational activities in the community and within psychiatric institutions, monitoring of practitioners who participated on the educational activities and follow up, maintaining local and regional network, disseminating and public awareness rising activities. During its work, Prostor has been recognized by the institutions as a partner in the reform of mental health system, in particular in the process of de-institutionalization, and has officially partnered with all major psychiatric institutions and the local government, especially through organization of educational activities for professionals, persons with mental health problems, students and NGOs. In the last 3 years, Prostor organized trainings accredited by the Regional Medical Chamber of Serbia as a part of continuous medical education. Through this project, Prostor staff will improve their organizational skills in the field of education and gain new knowledge and competences in monitoring and follow up of the implementation of gained knowledge in practice. Taking in consideration the importance of public awareness rising on the subject of mental health, prevention and human rights of psychiatric care users, Prostor is planning to undertake serious dissemination and PR efforts, promoting the results of this project and Erasmus+ program and support, and at the same time reaching to a wider public, aiming to improve the social status and life quality of psychiatric care users in Serbia.", "http://www.mindincamden.org.uk/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-RS01-KA104-000087_1"], ["8AB", "\"Art is in(clusion)!\"", "LoveLife Generation", 23079.0, "\"Art is in(clusion)!\" is a youth exchange that will take place in the city of \u017dilina from September 1 till September 10 2017. 45 young participants with and without disability, with and without or fewer opportunities from Portugal, Germany, Spain, Great Britain, Greece, Poland, Slovakia and Czech Republic will come together in mixed ability groups, will meet, get to know each other, exchange ideas and experience trans-national group dynamics.

VET - Experiences Abroad for Staff and Young graduates in VET\"  is part of the internationalization strategy of Essenia UETP, that foresees the implementation and the development of activities aimed at improving the quality and increasing the quantity of transnational mobility projects. \r\nBesides the transversal phases of management, monitoring and dissemination, the project foresees the implementation of the following activities, carried out according to procedures and methodologies already experimented over the years, and that guarantee high quality standards:\r\n-Information and sensitization\r\n-Selection of participants\r\n-Linguistic and pedagogical preparation\r\n-Logistic organization of mobilities\r\n-Evaluation of the project\r\n-Dissemination of project results\r\n-Follow-up\r\nThe quality procedures adopted are constantly improved and updated, also thanks to the use of new technologies and to the professional retraining of Essenia UETP\u2019s human resources, that occurs through training activities realized in the framework of Erasmus+ KA2 projects. Over the years, Essenia UETP  has further broadened its already wide network of European partners, identifying entities and companies able to offer transnational mobility experiences meeting high quality standards and preferring , among them, the ones of proved experience.  All over the National territory relationships with VET Institutes, public and private entities, companies have been consolidated  to assure congruence and coherence between the activities proposed and the needs of the users. At local level, Essenia UETP pursues  the objective of enhancing the cooperation with the bodies in charge of implementing the approaches and of adopting European methodologies and tools for the certification and validation of the competences (ECVET), in order to make the  formal and informal competences acquired by the participants during the mobility experiences more spendable on the labour market.", "http://socialspider.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005687_21"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4BD", "CATALYST IN COMMUNITIES LTD", 8781.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European youth area and the participation of young people in European democratic life (15.02.01.02)", "fts_2017_46325", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "E17"}
