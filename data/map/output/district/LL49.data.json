SUSREF is based on the premise that 1) Refurbishment of external walls is one of the most efficient ways of reducing environmental impacts from European building stock. 2) European building sector is facing huge refurbishment requirements; refurbishment of external walls is among the most urgent tasks. 3) Although there are technological solutions, the risks and optimal solutions are not understood. 4) External walls have an extensive effect on building performance and several aspects have to be taken into account when developing new concepts: a) effect on energy consumption, b) building physical behaviour and durability, c) good integration with building structure, details and building services, d) effect on indoor environment, e) aesthetics. 5) Urgent needs of refurbishment are not only faced in the EU but also in neighbouring areas. Development of functional and environmentally efficient technologies would support the European industry to export projects and the neighbouring areas to adopt sustainable technologies. SUSREF will 1) identify the foreseen needs to refurbish building envelops in the EU in order to understand the significance in terms of environmental and economic impacts and business potentials; 2) develop a systemized methods to manage the functional performance of solutions. Analyse technologies from the view point of building physics, comfort and durability. Consider different challenges in different parts of Europe in terms of present climate and foreseen risks of its changes, technological and cultural-historic issues; 3) develop systemized methods for consideration of energy and environmental performance of external walls; 4) develop sustainable product and project concepts; 5) disseminate results for building industry, standardisation bodies, and policy-makers and authorities in terms of technological knowledge, guidelines and recommendations.", 64086.0, 2961966.0, "SUSREF", "Green and friendly walls for European buildings", "Many of Europe's buildings are in need of refurbishment, in order to reduce environmental impact. The EU-funded SUSREF project aimed to develop new sustainable technologies for the refurbishment of external walls.", "Europe's building sector is facing major refurbishment requirements, with external walls representing one of the areas most urgently in need of attention. The walls have an extensive effect on the performance of buildings, and several aspects must be considered in developing solutions. Aspects include energy consumption, building physical behaviour and durability, integration with building structure, details and building services, and effect on indoor environment. Aesthetics are also an important aspect.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the project http://cic.vtt.fi/susref/ ('Sustainable refurbishment of building facades and external walls') (SUSREF) outlined a set of objectives aiming to address the issues discussed above. Partners worked to identify needs relevant to refurbishing buildings in the EU, in order to understand the related environmental and economic impacts. They developed a systemised approach for assessing and developing refurbishment concepts for exterior walls, and evolved general and specific refurbishment concepts. All project work was carried out with a view to being able to export the knowledge and technologies produced to neighbouring areas with similar needs.\n\nProject partners used existing models of refurbishment solutions, and further developed them to better suit SUSREF's overall goals and objectives. They also used existing and advanced technological solutions, and analysed, modelled, improved and developed concepts for selection to take into account regional and localised climatic conditions. The solutions also needed to ensure good functionality and optimise energy and environmental efficiency.\n\nThe potential savings in energy and costs were assessed using scenarios for the refurbishment of external walls. Although total investment cost was assessed at some EUR 28\u00a0000 million per year for energy-related refurbishments, annual savings in energy costs were assessed to stand at EUR 2\u00a0500 million. The estimated potential for carbon dioxide (CO2) savings is 72 million tonnes per year.\n\nSUSREF produced guidelines for refurbishment projects and the building industry, as well as recommendations for standardisation bodies and policymakers. Successful project outcomes contribute to the development of functional and environmentally efficient technologies and concepts that will support European industry. Beyond the advantages immediately relevant to Europe's building stock, industry will be able to export technology and projects, and support and advise neighbouring areas in their adoption of more sustainable technologies.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2013-03/56086.jpg", "fp7_92302_996503796"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LL49"}
