Supporting economic and life cycle assessment of the resulting gains in energy efficiency and conversion of renewable carbon, together with an implementation strategy based on a product mix with optimal value, will inform step changes that contribute to achieving more secure and sustainable sludge treatment and management practices in Europe while reducing pressure on natural resources and reliance on manufactured fertilisers.  Addressing key sludge management issues in the context of EU climate change mitigation and energy policies, the project concentrates on novel processes for sludge volume reduction, more efficient treatment and downstream processing for high quality sludge derivatives together with application protocols and assessment of the pathogen risk and long term soil impact for greater public confidence. Using an integrated approach with emphasis on the whole wastewater treatment system, the project promises innovative system solutions that have the potential to achieve up 20% annual carbon savings for the water industry by 2020 and ultimately could deliver up to 15,791,131 tCO2e pa savings for Europe.

MyToolBox will not only pursue a field-to-fork approach but will also consider safe use options of contaminated batches, such as the efficient production of biofuels. A major component of MyToolBox, which also distinguishes this proposal from previous efforts in the area mycotoxin reduction, is to provide the recommended measures to the end users along the food and feed chain in a web-based Toolbox. Cutting edge research will result in new interventions, which will be integrated together with existing measures in the Toolbox that will guide the end user as to the most effective measure(s) to be taken to reduce crop losses. We will focus on small grain cereals, maize, peanuts and dried figs, applicable to agricultural conditions in EU and China. Crop losses using existing practices will be compared with crop losses after novel pre-harvest interventions including investigation of genetic resistance to fungal infection, cultural control, the use of novel biopesticides (organic-farming compliant), competitive biocontrol treatment and development of forecasting models to predict mycotoxin contamination. Research into post-harvest measures including real-time monitoring during storage, innovative sorting of crops using vision-technology and novel milling technology will enable cereals with higher mycotoxin levels to be processed without breaching regulatory limits in finished products.

Europe has a major agricultural waste problem, generating some 700 million tonnes of waste annually. There is an urgent need and huge opportunity to address the efficient use of agricultural wastes, co-products and by-products (AWCB) towards delivering sustainable value chains in the farming and processing sectors. As such, AgroCycle will convert low value agricultural waste into highly valuable products, achieving a 10% increase in waste recycling and valorisation by 2020. This will be achieved by developing a detailed and holistic understanding of the waste streams and piloting a key number of waste utilisation/valorisation pathways. It will bring technologies and systems from ~TRL4 to ~TRL7 within the 3 years of the project. A post-project commercialisation plan will bring commercially promising technologies/systems to TRL8 and TRL9, ensuring AgroCycle will have an enduring impact by achieving sustainable use of AWCB both inside and outside the agricultural sector, leading to the realisation of a Circular Economy. \n\nAgroCycle addresses wastes from several agricultural sectors: wine, olive oil, horticulture, fruit, grassland, swine, dairy and poultry.

We currently offer French language teaching within our curriculum but we would like to extend and improve our provision. One of the main obstacles to high quality, consistent language teaching within our school is the lack of  confidence and language expertise amongst our teaching staff and support staff. We would therefore like to improve the confidence levels and develop the expertise in French language and French language teaching. This would in turn, raise the expectation and attainment of our pupils in French. We have a significantly high proportion of boys on role compared to girls and engaging boys in early language learning is crucial to maintaining life long language learning. In order to facilitate the skill improvement, CPD programme, curriculum and policy development we also need to develop the leadership and management skills of curriculum and subject leaders.\r\nOur objectives are:\r\nTo significantly increase confidence, skills and expertise in French language including grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation.\r\nTo significantly increase confidence, skills and expertise in French language teaching.\r\nTo develop teacher understanding of the pedagogies specific to language learning and teaching.\r\nTo establish a purposeful link with a French primary school.\r\nTo develop our use of ICT technologies in language learning and communication.\r\nTo broaden our pupils' understanding of the European Union and our part in it.\r\nTo enable our pupils to experience up to date European culture.\r\nTo develop a high profile, whole school approach to creative French language learning and teaching.\r\nTo develop the leadership and management skills of our curriculum leaders.\r\nTo develop the strategic planning and decision making skills of our curriculum leaders.\r\nWe only have two members of staff who consider themselves proficient in French language teaching. The majority of staff members do not have much experience of French and as result, the quality of French teaching is very variable across school. They also lack confidence in French speaking and pronunciation. These five members of staff require increased knowledge and understanding in the French language, grammar and pronunciation. \r\nFor the Leadership in Primary management course we have identified members of staff who are subject leaders within Primary Languages and International links. Their role is leading and managing the curriculum and diversifying the teaching styles within language teaching. Their identified area of need is leadership and management skills to enable them to successfully lead the CPD programme and undertake successful monitoring and evaluation of our Primary Languages curriculum. They would benefit greatly from experiencing alternative and effective management strategies in practice and gain a greater understanding of policy making and strategic decision making.\r\nThe training activities we are interested in undertaking are:\r\nTraining Course in Teaching and Learning of French Language and Culture for Primary Education (Lille, France)\r\nThis course will develop participant's knowledge and understanding of French language and increase competence and confidence in using French within the classroom.\r\nLeadership in Primary Education (Finland)\r\nThis course will develop participant's knowledge and understanding of the Finnish education system in order to broaden and deepen their understanding of primary practice and policy; improve management skills in order to operate within an international setting; develop curriculum leadership and management skills.\r\nExpected outcome and impact:\r\nImproved confidence in French language teaching; teachers will be inspired to teach French in a creative and engaging way. Developed and deepened understanding of French vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation; developed pedagogies specific to French language teaching; enhanced classroom practice; good practice shared with other participants; purposeful and collaborative link forged with a French primary school.\r\nIn the long term we hope to fully engage all learners in learning French and then hopefully additional languages. We hope to have a staff that are all confident with French teaching and to be providing high quality learning for all pupils across the school. We would also like to establish links with other European primary partners that will be as successful as our partnership with Makunga Primary, Kenya.", "http://www.tibbertonschool.org.uk", "Tibberton CE (Controlled) Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-001951_coordinator"], ["8NB", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "HARPER ADAMS UNIVERSITY", 2955.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.harper-adams.ac.uk", "HARPER ADAMS UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000158_coordinator"], ["8NB", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "HARPER ADAMS UNIVERSITY", 1947.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.harper-adams.ac.uk", "HARPER ADAMS UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012932_coordinator"], ["8NB", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "HARPER ADAMS UNIVERSITY", 7119.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.harper-adams.ac.uk", "HARPER ADAMS UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023575_coordinator"], ["8NB", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "HARPER ADAMS UNIVERSITY", 9778.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.harper-adams.ac.uk", "HARPER ADAMS UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035807_coordinator"], ["8NB", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "HARPER ADAMS UNIVERSITY", 15639.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.harper-adams.ac.uk", "HARPER ADAMS UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046825_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TF10"}
