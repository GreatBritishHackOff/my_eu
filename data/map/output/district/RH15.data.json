The aim will be to develop a new and scalable cockpit application which can extend operations of aircraft in degraded conditions \u2013 \u201cAll Conditions Operations\u201d. A key objective will be to deliver an extensible application that can be applied to many aircraft types.  This will necessarily entail a new cockpit infrastructure capable of delivering enhanced situation awareness to the crew whilst simultaneously reducing crew workload and improving overall aircraft safety.   All Conditions Operations, other challenging applications and the desire for reduced crew will mean that the crew station interface will be challenged beyond the reach of the current state-of-the-art. Accordingly, a radical rethink is required to manage the escalating complexity whilst simultaneously enhancing safety and controlling through life cost.  Thus, the next significant step in cockpit design will require a holistic integration of technologies allowing the crew to process and act on information concurrently and intuitively, using an optimum combination of their visual, tactile and audio senses.  In the concept envisaged, use will be made of precision navigation, synthetic vision, high integrity data bases, sensor and sensor data and image fusion, obstacle warning systems, taxi autopilots, touch screens, large area displays, voice/audio and multimodal input/output devices to deliver an All Conditions Operations application integrated within an enhanced crew interface. A major objective will be to deliver a common, and open standard interface which can manage existing core applications across all aircraft types whilst simultaneously supporting the needs of challenging new applications.  The ALICIA project is uniquely placed to deliver the capability necessary to facilitate the next big step in crew station design.", 55135.0, 40018775.0, "ALICIA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.cae.com", null, "fp7_94417_997807961"], ["8AN", "Development and Validation of an Innovative Solar Compact Selective-Water-Sorbent-Based Heating System", "Kokorelia Architects Limited", "The SWS-HEATING project will develop an innovative seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) unit with a novel storage material and creative configuration, i.e. a sorbent material embedded in a compact multi-modular sorption STES unit. This will allow to store and shift the harvested solar energy available abundantly during the summer to the less sunny and colder winter period thus covering a large fraction of heating and domestic hot water demand in buildings. The targeted benefit of this next generation solar heating technology is to reach and overcome a solar fraction of 60% in central/north Europe, reaching 80% in the sunnier south of Europe, with a compact and high-performing STES system at low cost, realising solar-active houses throughout EU.\nThe SWS-heating system is based on a multi-modular sorption seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) unit, using novel sorbent materials of Selective Water Sorbents (SWS) family characterised by superior heat storage density compared to the state of the art, making it possible to drastically decrease the storage volume with negligible thermal losses. These materials are employed in a sorption module with dedicated heat exchangers. Solar heat is provided to the storage modules by high-efficiency evacuated tube solar thermal collectors. Intensive research activities will deal with an advanced vacuum combi-storage tank, with the aim to further minimise thermal losses. A smart and adaptive control will be developed for efficiently managing heat supply and demand sides, including advanced features aiming at user-friendliness. A building prototype will be commissioned including the SWS-heating system, which will be tested and validated in Germany and Sweden and proof all challenging objectives.\nThe project also includes dissemination and communication activities to ensure outreach of its results.

This is the background behind establishment of the KAESER Apprentice Placement programme. It is one element within a larger phased plan (International Orientation of Training \u2013 Your Path to Becoming a KAESER Service Technician) encompassing specific development steps, from the first day of training through to the final objective: working as a service technician in one of KAESER\u2019s international branches. The phased plan presents all the steps along the way in a highly transparent manner for everyone involved in the process.\r\nOne of the most exciting development steps is the opportunity for apprentices to be placed at an international KAESER branch (Apprentice Placement). This opportunity is aimed at apprentices in their second and third years of a three and a half-year trade-based training programme (industrial mechanics, machining mechanics as well as electronics and mechatronics specialists). The most important aspect is to have a keen interest in working as a Service Technician.\r\nThe objectives of the apprenticeship are to raise interest in the profession of Service Technician, promote entrepreneurship and deepen intercultural and linguistic skills \u2013 while also making the prospect of living away from one\u2019s native country more tangible and appealing. Apprentices who take part in the programme will have the opportunity to live and work in a different country during their occupational training; an opportunity that will allow them to broaden their geographical horizons at an early stage in their career. \r\nIt is expected that the announcement of the programme will result in more applications for the additional internal training it takes to become a Service Technician from apprentices who have successfully completed their occupational training.\r\nThe Apprentice Placement programme will focus on KAESER branches within Europe. The company feels it has the best chance of attracting young people to establish their careers in other European countries following completion of their Service Technician training, as they will naturally find it easier to integrate into the local culture.\r\nThe apprenticeship always takes place during the summer holidays to ensure that apprentices do not miss out on any key material in their occupational training programme.", "http://www.hpccompressors.co.uk/home.asp", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003825_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "RH15"}
