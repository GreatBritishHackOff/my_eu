The aim will be to develop a new and scalable cockpit application which can extend operations of aircraft in degraded conditions \u2013 \u201cAll Conditions Operations\u201d. A key objective will be to deliver an extensible application that can be applied to many aircraft types.  This will necessarily entail a new cockpit infrastructure capable of delivering enhanced situation awareness to the crew whilst simultaneously reducing crew workload and improving overall aircraft safety.   All Conditions Operations, other challenging applications and the desire for reduced crew will mean that the crew station interface will be challenged beyond the reach of the current state-of-the-art. Accordingly, a radical rethink is required to manage the escalating complexity whilst simultaneously enhancing safety and controlling through life cost.  Thus, the next significant step in cockpit design will require a holistic integration of technologies allowing the crew to process and act on information concurrently and intuitively, using an optimum combination of their visual, tactile and audio senses.  In the concept envisaged, use will be made of precision navigation, synthetic vision, high integrity data bases, sensor and sensor data and image fusion, obstacle warning systems, taxi autopilots, touch screens, large area displays, voice/audio and multimodal input/output devices to deliver an All Conditions Operations application integrated within an enhanced crew interface. A major objective will be to deliver a common, and open standard interface which can manage existing core applications across all aircraft types whilst simultaneously supporting the needs of challenging new applications.  The ALICIA project is uniquely placed to deliver the capability necessary to facilitate the next big step in crew station design.", 55135.0, 40018775.0, "ALICIA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.cae.com", null, "fp7_94417_997807961"], ["8AN", "Development and Validation of an Innovative Solar Compact Selective-Water-Sorbent-Based Heating System", "Kokorelia Architects Limited", "The SWS-HEATING project will develop an innovative seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) unit with a novel storage material and creative configuration, i.e. a sorbent material embedded in a compact multi-modular sorption STES unit. This will allow to store and shift the harvested solar energy available abundantly during the summer to the less sunny and colder winter period thus covering a large fraction of heating and domestic hot water demand in buildings. The targeted benefit of this next generation solar heating technology is to reach and overcome a solar fraction of 60% in central/north Europe, reaching 80% in the sunnier south of Europe, with a compact and high-performing STES system at low cost, realising solar-active houses throughout EU.\nThe SWS-heating system is based on a multi-modular sorption seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) unit, using novel sorbent materials of Selective Water Sorbents (SWS) family characterised by superior heat storage density compared to the state of the art, making it possible to drastically decrease the storage volume with negligible thermal losses. These materials are employed in a sorption module with dedicated heat exchangers. Solar heat is provided to the storage modules by high-efficiency evacuated tube solar thermal collectors. Intensive research activities will deal with an advanced vacuum combi-storage tank, with the aim to further minimise thermal losses. A smart and adaptive control will be developed for efficiently managing heat supply and demand sides, including advanced features aiming at user-friendliness. A building prototype will be commissioned including the SWS-heating system, which will be tested and validated in Germany and Sweden and proof all challenging objectives.\nThe project also includes dissemination and communication activities to ensure outreach of its results. Moreover, exploitation activities include long-term deployment path development through a technology roadmap.", 67755.0, 4559661.0, "SWS-HEATING", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_214060_911556337"]]}}, "outwardCode": "RH15"}
