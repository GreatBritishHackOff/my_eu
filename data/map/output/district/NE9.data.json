We understand the great benefits that can result from international cooperation. We want to develop aspects of our curriculum and teaching methods, particularly improving the teaching of languages in our school and the introduction of new and innovative methods. We believe that languages should not be taught in isolation and we want to integrate our language teaching much more into other areas of the curriculum. We want to introduce many more cross curricular links, joint working and also to introduce CLIL to our school. \r\n\r\nWe are very keen to develop links with schools in Spain and France and would like our staff to have the opportunity to see how other European institutions approach the teaching of CLIL and cross curricular links. \r\n\r\nWe also would like to develop our international links in order to allow our pupils to have more native speaker contact and a greater insight into the reality of life in these countries, making their language learning experience more enjoyable. We believe that this will have a positive impact on the uptake of languages in our school and also on our pupils\u2019 future career choices. \r\n\r\nWe want teachers from other departments to develop language skills so that they are able to work jointly with staff from the MFL department to plan for cross curricular links and the introduction of CLIL. Other areas we wish to focus on as part of this project are; linking literacy and languages in order to support pupils\u2019 literacy development, increasing the use of ICT to support language learning in the development of links with other schools, improving uptake of languages in our school and increasing parental and community involvement in school life.\r\n\r\nWe want to build on work our school is currently doing as an outstanding training school and offer support to other schools.\r\nWe plan to develop project lasting two years that will help us to achieve our aims of modernising our approach to language teaching and becoming an outstanding example of cross curricular working.\r\n\r\nThis project will involve six members of staff each taking part in a progressive series of two courses in either Spain or France. \r\nThe members of staff taking part will be chosen from the MFL department and also from other departments within the school. This will mean that departments are able to work together to plan for a cross curricular approach to teaching and to introduce CLIL to our teaching practice.\r\n\r\nThe new approaches and teaching methods we acquire as part of these courses will result in better pupil engagement and a more enjoyable learning experience for them. Pupils will benefit from the increased confidence of staff and from the reinforcement of their learning across the curriculum. Staff will understand what makes successful CLIL. They will also have the chance to see this in practice through the schools that they will visit as part of the course. \r\n\r\nStaff will quickly develop proficiency in the language. We will develop links between languages and literacy and further engage our pupils through focusing on texts they enjoy and through teaching these through the foreign language. \r\n\r\nThe courses will give us new ideas for ways to raise the profile of languages in our school and involve parents more in their children\u2019s learning. We will also be able to gather ideas and resources which will help us to deliver cultural events that can be used as a way of furthering parental involvement.\r\n\r\nWe will use eTwinning and Skype and encourage our pupils to find out about each other\u2019s lives. All of this will make language leaning more appealing to our pupils and will result in more enthusiasm and greater uptake at GCSE and A Level.", "http://www.cardinalhume.com", "Cardinal Hume Catholic School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012793_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NE9"}
