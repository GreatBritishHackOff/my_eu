Companies falling short from meeting the IPPC requirements risk penalties such as substantial fines. Unlike large enterprises, small and medium sized companies lack the necessary human resources and in-house technical knowledge to keep updated with such legislations. In order to abide to the law, these companies are obliged to seek assistance from environmental consultants. These services are very costly and time consuming, due to the extensive material required to compile IPPC applications. The ENVIRON-MENTOR project aims to assist environmental consultants in guiding their clients to implement environmental normative and standards in an efficient manner. ENVIRON-MENTOR will offer a web-based environmental consultancy toolkit (utilizing artificial intelligence techniques) to the participating end-user SMEs in order to help them in their daily activities. Apart from IPPC, ENVIRON-MENTOR will offer support on environmental management systems (EMS) and provides guidelines for EMS standards such as EMAS and ISO 14 000. ENVIRON-MENTOR will also target the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) by providing an automated platform for the trading of greenhouse gases. This will enable environmental consultants to offer an efficient emissions trading service to their clients. Guidance to these environmental normative and standards will be provided by using a knowledge-base expert system and multi-agent system targeted for this scenario. Four participating environmental consultants, an IT software company and three RTDs from eight different countries have joined forces to develop this system.", 186450.0, 1355161.0, "ENVIRON-MENTOR", "Software-aided environmental compliance", "European businesses often need consultants to help them comply with environmental regulations. New software helps the consultants to help business.", "Europe has introduced strict environmental legislation, including the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive. While the legislation is generally well received, businesses sustain substantial time and financial costs in obtaining an IPPC compliance permit.\n\nThe eight-member ENVIRON-MENTOR project aimed to help. Given EUR\u00a01.2 million in EU funding over 2 years to October 2012, the consortium developed software to facilitate the IPPC application process. A web-based application, the ENVIRON-MENTOR expert system, was the result of the project's two scientific and seven technical objectives.\n\nNormally, a business applying for an IPPC permit would engage an environmental consultant for advice. ENVIRON-MENTOR assists the consultant in guiding small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), providing updated information about compliance measures. However, the software does not require specific knowledge of EU legislation, allowing environmental consultants who do not normally do IPPC certification to enter the market. The software relies on artificial intelligence tools for company profiling to tailor decision support.\n\nENVIRON-MENTOR uses its knowledge base to recommend the best available techniques for a given process. The application also contains the ISO\u00a014001 standard specifying requirements for an environmental management system, a component of the IPPC permit. The software facilitates implementation and accreditation of the standard, providing a set of steps that facilitate ISO\u00a014001 accreditation.\n\nThe software also handles carbon emissions trading. From 2013, a change came into effect, meaning that allowances would be auctioned. ENVIRON-MENTOR handles a type of auctioning platform built on multi-agent technology, which mimics the reasoning of humans in a real auction. This component of the system permits fair bidding for all players.\n\nFurthermore, the project set objectives related to training, dissemination and product exploitation. Information was disseminated via at least five major events, receiving positive feedback from participants. The project partner SMEs will commercialise the product via a spin-off company.\n\nThe project's software is expected to streamline IPPC application processes and carbon trading. With instant access to current legislation and standards, environmental consultants will be able to offer more effective and efficient services to business. The project expects a return of EUR\u00a04.5 million within five years of the project completion, representing an investment return of EUR\u00a03.7 million.", "http://www.environmentor-project.com", "http://www.ippc-consultants.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58329.jpg", "fp7_96618_985101252"], ["3EH", "Power consumption driven Reliability, Operation and Maintenance optimisation", "Monition Limited", "The normal strategy to keep production systems in good conditions is to apply preventive maintenance practices, with a supportive workforce \u201creactive\u201d in the case of clearly detected malfunctions. This impact on quality, cost and in general, productivity. Added to this, the uncertainty of machine reliability at any given time, also impacts on product/production delivery times. It is known also that a worn-out mechanism has higher energy consumption.\nThe use of intelligent predictive technologies could contribute to improve the situation, but these techniques are not widely used in the production environment. Often sensors and monitors required for the production environment are non standard and require costly implementations.\nPower-OM propose to use the electric current consumption monitoring and profiling, as an easy to implement condition based maintenance (CbM) technique, and manage it also as a way to improve the overall business effectiveness, under a triple perspective:\n\u2022 Optimizing maintenance strategies based on the prediction of potential failures and schedule maintenance operations in convenient periods and avoid unexpected breakdowns\n\u2022 Operation: Managing energy as a production resource and reduce its consumption\n\u2022 Product reliability: Providing the machine tool builder with real data about the behaviour of the product and their critical components\nThis universal solution should also be compatible with the added value information that could come from existing sources (control) and sensors used at the machine, and jointly this will preserve current and future investment in the field. The project will research also in the required infrastructure and new business model for maintenance services provider.\nPower-OM will be applied in machine tools, focussing on spindles and linear guides as responsible for the most common and cost-intensive downtimes.

This is due to enhanced instrumentation of equipment and advanced tools for analysing condition data. However, they are not used much by plants and factories because they are expensive.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Power consumption driven reliability, operation and maintenance optimisation' (http://www.power-om.eu (POWER-OM)) project is working on a smart, implementable and cost-effective method that will minimise spare parts costs, system downtime and time spent on maintenance.\n\nIntelligent technology being designed by POWER-OM will be applied to the two key machine tool components \u2014 spindles and linear guides \u2014 that are most responsible for downtime.\n\nPOWER-OM has put forth several key objectives. It aims to prevent equipment failure for spindles and linear guides by 75\u00a0%, increase the average time between spindle and linear guide failures during operation by 25\u00a0%, and reduce energy consumption by 5\u00a0%.\n\nResearchers are devising a method to monitor and analyse energy data during the production process. By doing so, they will be able to predict when equipment is going to fail or performance is deteriorating in order to perform maintenance. This interoperable solution will be compatible with existing machine sensors used at factories and plants.\n\nThe project team is also setting up a web-based platform that will make remote functions available for the POWER-OM components installed in each machine.\n\nProject outcomes will allow personnel to best decide on when to carry out maintenance on equipment and to use real-time data to optimise their resources.

Outcomes from CGS are even worse in, females, the elderly (mortality>70%) and high risk sub-groups. The incidence of CGS in Europe alone is >50 000 patients pa. This unacceptably high mortality/morbidity rate represents a true unmet clinical need. No clear strategy exists to improve outcomes, with ad hoc therapies given too late in a spiralling, irrecoverable process.\nEURO SHOCK aims to improve outcomes for CGS patients. At its core is a robust phase3 randomised trial comparing a novel strategy of very early use of ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) to current standard of care. Evidence suggests very early ECMO will halt the spiral of decline and so significantly reduce 12 month death rate and need for heart failure re-admissions. Since both costs of CGS, and ECMO are high a health-economic cost efficacy analysis will be core. A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging sub-study will test novel protocols in sick patients and provide mechanistic data. We will test transfer networks for CGS patients and analyse ECG data to determine which patients benefit most from early transfer.\nOur multidisciplinary consortium comprises renowned physician-scientists, statisticians, health economists and technology providers, including specialised ECMO SME. \nEURO SHOCK will impact on heart attack survivors, healthcare providers and Europe`s medical technology sector by 1) reducing healthcare costs associated with CGS 2) provide novel cost effective framework for cardiac interventions 3) delivering innovative healthcare technologies and 4) informing guidelines for effective CGS intervention.", 691782.0, 5664617.0, "EURO SHOCK", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_212681_919495302"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2RS", "CHALICE MEDICAL LIMITED", 692348.0, "Improving lifelong health and well-being (08.02.03.01)", "fts_2017_5151", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "S80"}
