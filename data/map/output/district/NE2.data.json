The project is built on the innovative concepts of super-sensitive and highly specific \u201clab-on-a-bead\u201d, \u201clab-on-a-chip\u201d and \u201clab-on-a-wire\u201d nano-devices utilizing photoluminescent, plasmonic, magnetic and non-linear optical properties of nanomaterials. This offers groundbreaking advantages over present technologies in terms of stability, sensitivity, time of analysis, probe multiplexing, assay miniaturisation and reproducibility. The ETP in Nanomedicine documents point out that nanotechnology has yet to deliver practical solutions for the patients and clinicians in their struggle against common, socially and economically important diseases such as cancer. Over 3.2M new cases and 1.7M cancer-related deaths are registered in Europe every year, largely because diagnostic methods have an insufficient level of sensitivity, limiting their potential for early disease identification. We will deliver \u2022Photoluminescent nanoparticle-based reagents and diagnostic chips for high throughput early diagnosis of cancer and treatment efficiency assessment \u2022Nanocrystals enabling plasmon-optical and nonlinear optical monitoring of molecular receptors within body fluids or on the surface of cancer cell \u2022Multi-Parameter screening of cancer biomarkers in diagnostic material implementing segmented magnetic nanowires \u2022Validation of nano-tools for early diagnosis and highly improved specificity in cancer research. \u2022OECD-compliant nanomaterials with improved stability, signal strength and biocompatibility Direct lead users of the results will be the diagnostic and medical imaging device companies involved in the consortium, clinical and academic partners", 569721.0, 13900269.0, "NAMDIATREAM", "Advanced cancer screening and early diagnostics", "Lung, breast and prostate cancer are among the most common types of cancer, and early diagnosis plays a critical role in decreasing mortality.

EU-funded scientists exploited the latest in nanotechnology to deliver nanotools for clinical, laboratory and point-of-care devices with work on the http://www.namdiatream.eu/joomla/ (NAMDIATREAM) (Nanotechnological toolkits for multi-modal disease diagnostics and treatment monitoring) project. The toolkits are based on four different technological platforms, each with unique nanotechnology feature applied for unprecedented efficiency of cancer diagnostics. They detect biomarkers of cancer and cancer cells in microlitre volumes of blood and urine.\n\nExploitation of fluorescent nanomaterials (quantum dots) enabled the creation of ultra-small diagnostic probes covered with single-domain antibodies against tumour biomarkers. This tool offers superior sensitivity and photostability compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, as well as the capability for multiplexed detection of tumour molecular signatures.\n\nAnother immunodiagnostic device relies on antibody-functionalised magnetic core/noble metal shell nanorods that bind tumour biomarkers. The resulting change in the optically observed dynamic response to an externally applied time-varying magnetic field enables the detection and quantification of target molecule concentration in a straightforward biological sample.\n\nNanocrystals with non-linear optical properties take the advantage of the infrared spectrum for unique deep tissue imaging with enhanced sharp contrast against the surrounding background. Selectively targeted to tumour cells, they provide a stable long lasting signal and therefore efficient cancer detection and monitoring. Three products based on this technology have already been licensed and commercialised.\n\nFinally, segmented magnetic nanowires acting as barcode-type labels for disease marker detection were paired with unique optical-magnetic sensor detection platform for selective multiplexed detection of cancer biomarkers.\n\nSuch achievements were secured through the large consortium commitment to deliver high quality, safety-assured and scalable products validated in matching in vitro models for pre-clinical testing, and benchmarked against both clinical and industrial gold standards.\n\nThe outstanding work resulted in selection of NAMDIATREAM as the best of over 1,000 projects in the field of nanotechnologies and advanced materials funded by EU funding entities.\n\nContributing to the European industrial and societal improvement, these tools foster early detection of cancer with reduced invasiveness, cost effectiveness and ease of use with the objective to simplify routine population screening for prompt intervention with drastically improved patient treatment outcomes and reduced health care costs.", "http://www.namdiatream.eu", "http://selectiveantibodies.com/www/", "/docs/results/images/2015-10/163114.jpg", "fp7_94840_995416038"], ["4HH", "Selective Antibodies Limited Immuno Assay Novel Technology", "Selective Antibodies Limited", "SALIANT aims to develop a hand-held device for real-time analysis of trace levels of explosives, chemicals and drugs. The key innovation is a positive detection lateral-flow test for small molecules that is highly sensitive and simple to use making it ideally suited to deployment by First Responders at crime scenes and terrorist incidents. Lateral flow immunodiagnostics has long offered the promise of fast, high quality testing for substances of low molecular weight. There have however been very real challenges to bringing the full power of such technology to bear in this area. The problem is simply size. Large analytes can support the simultaneous binding of both capture and detector antibodies, allowing typical excess-reagent sandwich immunoassays to be formatted in which increasing analyte concentration provides an increase of observable signal over a very low zero background. Small molecules are simply not large enough to support such simultaneous binding. Alternative systems in effect measure how much analyte is not present. This causes major problems in terms of precision, sensitivity and read-out where, classically, increasing concentration of analyte reduces the signal produced, making point-of-need devices often difficult to read. What is required is a robust system in which there is no observable signal in the absence of analyte, and even low level samples give an obvious observable signal over this zero background. SALIANT offers a system based on a small bindable moiety that is first conjugated close to the binding site of a primary antibody against the analyte such that when analyte binds the antibody, the moiety can still be bound by a labelled secondary antibody. A large reagent-analogue of the analyte is also introduced, binding analyte-unbound primary antibody, and thereby blocking binding of the secondary antibody to the moiety. Thus the more analyte present, the more binding of secondary antibody occurs and the more signal is produced.", 1000949.0, 3779421.0, "SALIANT", null, null, null, "http://www.saliant.eu/home", "http://selectiveantibodies.com/www/", null, "fp7_95761_995416038"], ["2QT", "development of a tool for effective diagnostic monitoring of honey bee colonies", "Arnia Limited", "There are 600,000 beekeepers in the European sector, mainly SME family-owned companies. The revenue generated by this industry is more than \u20ac400M in Europe. However, the European Union has a net negative trade-balance in bee products, mainly honey, producing only 54% of its demand (the EU imports from cheaper producers, namely Argentina and China). However, despite its importance and the obvious potential for growth, serious problems face the sector. Bee populations and beekeepers numbers in Europe have been falling at an alarming rate. Honey imports to the EU have risen by 20% since 2001. Action to halt the decline in the European beekeeping sector is also urgently needed because bees also play a vital role in agricultural productivity. The role of bees as a pollinator remains the most important economic contribution, far outweighing the collective importance of all hive products. The economic value of pollination worldwide is estimated to be at least \u20ac153 billion, which represented 9.5% of the value of the world agricultural production used for human food in 2005. More than 70% of food crops and 35% of food production still depend on pollinators; 84% of vegetables grown in Europe depend on pollination.\nOur project will develop the first monitoring tool that would detect changes in honey bee activity within the beehive for the effective management of bees. Changes in the activity within the hive will indicate early signs of potential swarming and possible poor health, so the beekeeper can intervene to manage the colony. The tool will allow beekeepers to remotely diagnose colony status without the invasive opening of hives for physical inspection.\nThis will increase the efficiency of beekeeping allowing small and hobby beekeepers to more closely manage their colonies and predict behaviour that requires intervention remotely, and will allow commercial beekeepers to keep more hives over greater geographical distances so increasing their efficiency and profitability.", 267382.0, 1467690.0, "Swarmonitor", "Monitoring honeybee for health and swarming prediction", "New tools for beekeepers to monitor the health and status of bee colonies remotely may benefit agricultural and honey industries by increasing productivity and pollination.", "Although there are 600\u00a0000 beekeepers in Europe, honey production is not keeping up with demand, due partly to an alarming decline in bee populations. Smaller populations affect not only honey production but also the 70\u00a0% of food crops and 84\u00a0% of vegetables that depend on pollinators.\n\nBeekeepers traditionally monitor bee health by physically opening and inspecting apiaries, which is time consuming and invasive regardless of whether intervention is required. The EU-funded http://www.swarmonitor.com/ (SWARMONITOR) (Development of a tool for effective diagnostic monitoring of honey bee colonies) project aims to develop tools for remote, non-invasive hive monitoring.\n\nSWARMONITOR's monitoring tool will detect changes and patterns of vibrations in the hive, which may indicate swarming, health disorders or deterioration in the hive. Swarming occurs when the queen leaves the hive with most of the worker bees to establish new colonies, and needs to be managed by beekeepers.\n\nResearchers fitted hives with instruments called accelerometers that measure vibrations, the data for which can be collected remotely. They encouraged swarming in a dedicated apiary with 20 hives fitted with accelerometers and commercial monitoring equipment that records the spectrum of vibrations.\n\nUsing vibrational data, researchers gave vibration patterns statistical scores that allow advance warning of a swarming event about to occur. Researchers are also using these experimental hives to monitor health conditions, including infestations by bee pathogens that can cripple an entire colony.\n\nSWARMONITOR's remote monitoring tools will allow more effective and less labour-intensive apiary management.

Nowadays European citizens consider the decline in bee numbers to be the most serious\nenvironmental issue \u2013 more than climate change.\nThe IoBee consortium wants to disrupt the beekeeping market by reducing colony losses by at least 50%! Through this\nproject, we aim to pilot and commercialise a new Internet of Things (IoT) sensor application that can automatically assess\nthe threat status to a colony. The system will wirelessly transmit results to a cloud server, making field data available for\nrunning prediction models, perform risk assessments, issue warnings and make historical analysis using a SDSS- Spatial\nDecision Support System. This will allow beekeepers to be active participants in colony surveillance programmes with\nunprecedented accuracy and responsiveness, and as a result, unhealthy or threatened colonies will be remotely detected\nearlier with greater precision, saving millions of Euros in potential losses.\nMany systems to monitor beehives already exist in the market.
