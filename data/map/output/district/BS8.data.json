This was thought to represent a key vertebrate innovation, allowing jawed vertebrates to outcompete their jawless rivals. Recent discoveries however, shed a different light on the evolution of teeth and jaws. i) tooth-like structures were found on gill arches in a primitive jawless vertebrate, indicating that teeth evolved prior to jaws. ii) the first jawed vertebrates appear to be toothless. These data demonstrate that tooth and jaw evolution were not coordinated, contradicting previous scenarios. Among living gnathostomes, the two major groups are chondrichthyans (shark, rays) and osteichthyans (bony jawed vertebrates). Crucially, we lack insight into the development of teeth and jaws in early osteichthyans. Our current knowledge is based only on two  members of this clade, representing two important laboratory models: the Zebrafish, an actinopterygian, and mouse, a sarcopterygian tetrapod.

How did the rise of birds affect potential competitors (pterosaurs) and their sister theropod group? Do successful clades diversify equally or is the diversification driven by particular subclades? How did the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction affect the evolution of birds? And more generally, how do diversity and disparity relate to each other?

Integrated water quality models designed to predict the quality of water across the linked urban and rural scales in a catchment is seen as a tool to optimise this cost. Integrated Catchment Modelling (ICM) is based on linking numerous empirically calibrated sub-models of water quality processes.  Catchment scale WQ predictions are then used to justify investment. Current water quality sub-models contain significant uncertainty.  Methods have been developed to quantify uncertainty at a level however little work has been carried out to investigate WQ uncertainty propagation between sub-models. QUICS will develop a generalised catchment wide approach to uncertainty assessment that can then be used in WFD implementation studies. It will address uncertainty propagation at the spatial and temporal scales found in catchments and develop tools to reduce uncertainty by optimising sampling and monitoring and the objective selection of model structure. This will reduce uncertainty in WQ predictions and result in better informed investment decisions and so have a significant impact on WFD implementation.

Only after dinosaur extinction (at the end of the Mesozoic) did mammals diversify into larger and more specialized forms, and so suppression by dinosaur competition is the usual explanation for this evolutionary pattern.

Towards the end of the Cretaceous, angiosperm leaf morphology had evolved such that the trees would be able to create their own microhabitats, making rain forests possible. This time period provides a window of opportunity to see if mammal evolution changed in response to the encroaching angiosperm dominance.

In particular, the research will be used to understand the relationship between anisotropic seismic velocities and pressurisation of magma reservoirs by inverting SWS data for geomechanical parameters. The models will make use of multidisciplinary constraints such as ground deformation, petrological evidence and seismicity, all of which provide evidence for depths, pressures and timing of magma movement. Case studies will include Okmok Volcano in Alaska, Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, and Ruapehu and Tongariro Volcanoes in New Zealand. This work will represent a significant advance in our understanding of the interaction of subsurface magma movement with the state of stress in the country rock, as well as provide crucial new insights into the potential of SWS as a monitoring tool.", 180539.0, 180539.0, "SAMS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.bristol.ac.uk", null, "fp7_108683_999974262"], ["1TH", "Signal reliability and decision making in social birds", "University of Bristol", "Vocalisations play a key communicatory role in many social species and individuals often rely on information provided by others.

The goal of this project is to address largely unexplored aspects of signaller reliability and the resultant decisions made by other group members, using a wild, but habituated, population of pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor), a social bird species.

Amongst candidate systems for transporting quantum information, photons are the most promising as they can both maintain coherence over long distances, and interact strongly with electrons to generate nonlinear effects and allow transfer of information between subsystems. As a result, use of photons as 'qubits' has led to ground-breaking demonstrations of quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography. However in many of the devices being developed for use in quantum photonics, particularly solid-state devices such as single photon sources, decoherence suffered by the participating electrons is a key limiting factor, reducing the interaction strength and randomizing the quantum state of the photons. In order to minimise the effect of electron decoherence, such devices must generally be operated under cryogenic conditions; even then, in many cases, other noise mechanisms are revealed which limit device functionality. As a result of these practical obstacles and performance limitations, single photon sources have yet to find widespread use and photonic quantum information is largely confined to laboratory demonstrators.The WASPS project seeks to overcome these major bottlenecks in the technology by taking a revolutionary approach. Namely, we plan to exploit the potential of cavity quantum electrodynamics in the bad emitter limit where decoherence is mostly due to the artificial atom. In this limit, preliminary results show that cavity filtering properties and the Purcell effect can be used to engineer the electron-photon interaction, thereby turning electron decoherence into an advantage rather than an obstacle.

These are systems that guarantee continuous and correct operation in the existence of different types of faults. It is a well known fact that various systems are extremely sensitive to faults. Typical examples are medical (i.e. implantable cardiac pacemakers) or automotive systems (i.e. vehicle stability control), in which the shortest stop in operation will cause dramatic damages. Therefore, such applications require a fault-tolerant system, which guarantees correct and reliable functioning at any time.However, as semiconductor technology scales, chips are becoming ever less reliable; prominent reasons for this phenomenon are the sheer number of transistors on a given silicon area and their shrinking device features. As a consequence, fault tolerance, e.g. provided through various redundancy schemes, has an enormously increasing power and performance cost. To make matters worse, power-density is becoming a significant limiting factor for performance and SoC design in general. In the face of such changes in the technological landscape, current solutions for fault-tolerance are expected to introduce an excessive overhead in future SoCs.

Compared to existing approaches, the DeSyRe objective is to reduce the power and performance overheads of fault-tolerance by 10-20%, as well as to improve yield by decreasing the number of defective chips by 10-40%.The above will be achieved through the design of fault-tolerant systems built out of unreliable components, rather than aiming at totally fault-free chips.

The first is to provide a number of discrete learning interventions, which can be delivered either through a web-based trading platform or in a day-trading facility, to enhance the quality of financial decision-making by private investors trading on their own account.  Within that overall objective, the principal goal is to address issues of emotional regulation in financial decision making.  In common with many other areas where technology has been used to assist learning, financial training has largely focused on imparting propositional knowledge and increasing people's intellectual understanding. However, our work to date has shown that despite investors having considerable appropriate knowledge, their actions can still be ruled by their attitudes, habits, or emotional states. Emotions not only mediate rapid expert situation recognition and the application of expert intuition, but they also give rise to important persistent biases in decision-making through framing effects and the disposition effect in particular.  Game based technologies are becoming proven as a method of learning, particularly as they can place people in virtual situations.  In the context of financial decision making, xDelia will use serious games to analyse and train behavioural patterns and to support the non-formal and informal learning process.  The project will produce learning interventions which employ physiological sensors alongside serious games.  Wearable sensor equipment will help build a picture of a person's emotional state.  Data collected via sensors in both game play and during actual trading will be analysed alongside real time event logging, diaries and past trading data.  The validity and effectiveness of the interventions will be tested and further developed through a series of trials, including 'live' testing with private investors.  Because of the problems of transfer of skills learned into actual practice and the need to support the development of expertise over extended periods, learning interventions developed by the project cannot rely solely on learning games.  We have therefore developed an approach combining games, sensor feedback, and didactic materials with a structured, diary based approach to reflection on practice in order to support transfer of learning into the 'real-world' practice setting.By investigating this phenomenon and tackling directly the challenges faced by investors, the project will demonstrate the potential to achieve improvements in emotion regulation processes through innovative, technologically supported approaches using a combination of physiological sensors, emotion regulation training , and serious games in a real-world setting.", 95903.0, 3612026.0, "xDELIA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.bristol.ac.uk", null, "fp7_89453_999974262"], ["1TH", "University Reform, Globalization and Europeanization", "University of Bristol", "This multidisciplinary exchange programme examines how processes of regionalization and globalization are redefining the nature and scope of universities.

The 27-member consortium put many other processes likely to be affected under the microscope. These include nutrient uptake, reproduction, acid-base regulation, nitrogen fixation and primary production. Changes in the dynamics of these biological processes are likely to affect marine flora and fauna profoundly.\n\nThe four-year long project produced results based on four themes. One of the major findings under the first, ocean chemistry, is that acidification measured in terms of pH drop in the Arctic near Iceland is 50\u00a0% faster than average rates in sub-tropical zones in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nFor biological and ecosystem responses, EPOCA researchers studied a broad range of marine life. There is now robust evidence that many calcifying organisms are adversely affected by ocean acidification although there is considerable difference in sensitivity, even between closely related species. Citing just one of the alarming effects of acidification that came to light, severe tissue damage in Atlantic cod larvae was recorded. Synergistic effects of multiple stressors, including warming, deoxygenation and eutrophication, were also investigated.\n\nProject researchers coupled Earth system models (ESMs), global and regional ocean models, and a sediment model to anticipate how acidification will alter ocean biogeochemistry.

Therefore, better understanding of the regulation and consequences of synaptic SUMOylation is of fundamental importance.

The second challenging goal was the development of techniques for evaluating the bonded components. Scientists defined this newly developed quality assurance technology as extended NDT (ENDT).\n\nFirstly, the most representative aeronautic application scenarios were identified. Suitable specimens were developed  and characterised using ENDT methods. The results were compared with those of a variety of conventional analytical methods and mechanical testing to evaluate their suitability for the specific measurement tasks.\n\nAmong others, researchers applied optical methods like laser scanning vibrometry, active thermography and a wetting test to characterise the state of adhered surfaces. Sensor-based techniques such as embedded optical fibre sensors or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were also tested as well as laser-excited and non-linear ultrasonic techniques.\n\nIn total, 31 ENDT technologies were tested for the assessment of adhered surfaces and the evaluation of adhesive bonds. In particular, for each of the aeronautic application scenarios, several techniques were applied to detect different contamination levels and passed the validation process. Knowledge gained regarding the effects of bond degradation will guide necessary design improvements.\n\nThe implementation of reliable assessment technology will lead to an increased use of CFRP components for highly integrated structures. The expected weight savings for the fuselage airframe will be up to 15 %. That will have further effects on the engine size and weight. Overall weight savings will result in significant reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions per passenger-kilometre.", null, "http://www.bristol.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-08/156281.jpg", "fp7_96479_999974262"], ["4HG", "Control and Alleviation of Loads in Advanced Regional Turbo Fan Configurations", "Stirling Dynamics Ltd", "A novel adaptive winglet concept will be developed to enable controlled cant angle orientation and twist throughout the flight envelope whilst also providing a passive gust loads alleviation capability.

Until recently, however, there was no evidence for teaching in non-human animals. Now teaching has been shown in a small but diverse group of animals, all of them social. Teaching, according to the definition that is well established in evolutionary biology, must incur a cost or provide no immediate benefit to the experienced individual, i.e. the leader. This raises the question under what conditions does teaching evolve? Sociality is shaped by selection that operates, in part, at the family or colony level. Thus the leader incurs a cost and/or has no immediate benefit, but teaching will be beneficial at the colony level. Recent studies suggest that under a constantly changing environment (e.g. food supply) there will not necessarily be a direct link between an increase in individual performance after information transfer and collective energy gain of the colony. I will examine the effect of spatial and temporal availability of food on the benefits and costs of teaching at the individual and colony level of the tandem running ant Temnothorax albipennis. T. albipennis can forage towards a goal such as food, by two main strategies: (1) foraging alone, (2) teaching by tandem running, i.e., a leader teaches a na\u00efve follower. In the second case there is strong bi-directional feedback of information between leader and follower.

The study questioned whether a colony's internal and external environments affect the degree and success of teaching. Another question was whether teaching evolved according to simple rules. The project ran between January 2012 and January 2014.\n\nTeaching in ants consists of tandem running, whereby two T.\u00a0albipennis individuals forage side by side and exchange considerable quantities of information. The study quantified the time allocated to tandem running, depending on several environmental and internal variables. The method can be applied to other animal groups, and yields an understanding of teaching efficiency.\n\nProject members found that teaching strongly depends on the individuals' and group's internal hunger state. Increase in hunger rates affects the rates of information being sought and given. The level of starvation, rather than a period of food deprivation, resolves inconsistencies in previous studies regarding the costs/benefits of teaching.\n\nIndividual starvation level was also a key factor affecting the frequency of teaching the location of a new nest site. Starvation can affect the quality of teaching, which affects the selection of quality nest sites. Hence, the study concluded that teaching plays a vital role in group decision making.\n\nThe research documented several other nuances of teaching behaviour and its relation to information accuracy as well as the adaptive importance of exploration.

This will greatly improve our insights of the response of Arctic glaciers to climate changes, their contribution to sea level rise and serve as a validation tool for the development of glacier components which are poorly represented in globally coupled climate models.\nDuring the first 2 years of the project, the applicant will be hosted by John Wahr at CIRES in Boulder, Co. The final year of the project will be spend at the Bristol Glaciology Center with Jonathan Bamber.

The study is based on an extensive collection of ground measurements and data from the latest European Space Agency (ESA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellites, and climate models.\n\nScientists developed new methods for the processing of data from CryoSat-2, the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) missions. The software prepared for MAGICS estimates surface changes with higher accuracy than existing algorithms and has led to the identification of sudden and rapid ice loss in a previously stable region of the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\nPrevious estimates, based solely on field measurements and few localised observations, sometimes overestimated ice loss when the findings were extrapolated over large regions. Owing to the developed algorithms for the MAGICS project, researchers were able to precisely constrain changes in all of the world's land ice.\n\nResearchers found that all glaciers lost ice mass during the last decade, with the biggest losses observed in Arctic Canada, Alaska, Greenland, the southern Andes and the Himalayas. In addition, 1 % of land ice contributed more to sea-level rise than the massive Antarctic ice sheet.\n\nAnthropogenic global warming, as well as multi-year fluctuations in the atmosphere and ocean currents, may be the source of the observed ice loss. The findings so far have been presented in international conferences and described in peer-reviewed publications in renowned journals such as Science and Nature Geoscience.\n\nThe MAGICS project suggests that there may be enough satellite data to detect mass loss of glaciers and ice sheets as a whole with some level of confidence.

As a new medium, animated film was marked by shifting understandings of its identity, with animated films themselves often experimenting with and reflecting on the form. Sometimes situating themselves within contexts of modernity and modernism, animated films negotiated the place of animation as a medium within a wider cultural and social field. Animation was also closely entwined with other media and arts; in addition to live action film, music, comic strips, illustrated books and theatre all played a prominent role in the constitution and development of animated film. Further shaping its identity, the reception and discourse of animation \u2013 including marketing, theorizations and discussions in the popular press \u2013 contributed to an emerging sense of what animation was, what it could (or should) do, and what its place in a wider context of visual culture entailed.

In the hippocampus, two forms of long-lasting changes in synaptic activity \u2014 long-term potentiation and long-term depression (LTD) \u2014 are thought to underlie learning and memory processes. Of the three ionotropic glutamate receptors, it is the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) that mediates the majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmissions in spines. Most AMPARs are calcium impermeable. The incorporation of AMPAR GluA2 subunit is important for this functional characteristic and this occurs before the exit from endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER is dynamically distributed in subpopulations of hippocampal dendritic spines. These ER-containing spines can play important roles in many neuronal functions, and ER expulsion from spines is likely to affect spine signaling and plasticity. But whilst research on receptor trafficking and the associated postsynaptic protein complex has greatly advanced our understanding on LTD, the contribution of spine ER dynamics has been over-looked. In this connection, the present proposal aims to test the hypothesis that dynamic ER distribution in spines can contribute to synaptic plasticity by elucidating whether there are any common mechanisms regulating AMPAR GluA2 subunits and ER dynamics in relation to metabotropic glutamate receptor dependent LTD induction. This is a novel approach and requires combination of advanced live-cell imaging and electrophysiological recordings to study how the structural and functional plasticity in a single spine accords with the dynamic change in ER and the intracellular molecular events.

The EU-funded project SYNAPTIC ER (Understanding mechanisms regulating endoplasmic reticulum dynamics in hippocampal synaptic plasticity) has found a connection between glutamate receptors and endoplasmic reticulum (ER).\n\nDuring transmission, the signal travels from an axon of one neuron to the dendrite of a second neuron, receiving an input. The surface of a dendrite has dendritic spines, or small protrusions. Interestingly, some dendritic spines contain ER. These ER-containing spines are highly dynamic but the role of ER in dendritic spines has not been studied in detail.\n\nThe scientists expressed different fluorescent markers in hippocampal neuronal cultures. The markers allowed them to follow the internalisation of glutamate receptors at synapses and to visualise the ER. The imaging experiments on ER-containing and ER-lacking spines showed that there was no correlation between AMPA receptor internalisation and ER content. However the activity of the NMDA receptor was found to be responsible for changes in spine size and the associated ER dynamics. Activation of NMDA receptors promoted rapid ER expansion in growing spines.\n\nThe SYNAPTIC ER project has added to the knowledge base defining the role and mechanisms regulating spine ER dynamics in synaptic physiology.

By providing detailed analyses of both Tethyan key sections and ODP legs, we seek to better constrain the onset and the duration of reducing conditions and relate these changes to the perturbations of the global carbon cycle during the Valanginian, the early Aptian and the Cenomanian/Turonian OAE.\nWe propose to investigate the behaviour of molybdenum (Mo) isotopes during these three periods of time. Mo isotopes provide a method to assess whole ocean chemistry from a limited numbers of sites. In the modern ocean, the preferential removal of the lighter isotopes under oxic conditions dominates, leading to a heavy Mo isotope signature for residual Mo in seawater. During OAEs, the emplacement of a larger completely anoxic sink diminished the dominance of oxic sinks. As a consequence the Mo isotope signature of seawater decreased towards that of the input. Thus, marine sediments deposited under euxinic conditions are thought to record the Mo isotopic composition of seawater at that time. From this, it is possible to estimate the proportion of euxinic areas in ancient oceans using a quantitative model of Mo isotopic balance.\nThe importance of this project lies in the observation that Cretaceous OAEs are related to phases of rapid global environmental change.

The first site sampled was not suitable for testing this process because conditions were not fully euxinic.

Applications of SynBio research include environmental and health benefits, for example bio-fuels, biosensors and therapeutics.\nResearchers in SynBio are keen to address the ethical, legal and social aspects of their work. To date, however, ELSI considerations of SynBio have targeted safety and regulatory aspects of the field as a whole. No studies have focussed specifically on the ethical implications of SynBio for human health. The SYBHEL project will address this gap to provide the first detailed analysis of one of the key global applications of SynBio.\nSYBHEL will examine several aspects of SynBio as it applies to human health including: philosophical and social understandings of life (including new human-like entities); appropriate methodology for bioethical analysis in SynBio for health; ethical issues arising in utilising SynBio for health; regulatory and commercial aspects and public policy in SynBio for health care.\nThe RTD work-packages will be underscored by several cross-cutting themes to ensure maximum flexibility and relevance of outcomes. SYBHEL will therefore be informed by existing work on: the definition and scientific state of the art of SynBio; safety aspects and issues of distributive justice. SYBHEL will adopt an approach that recognises the non-reductionist, non-essentialist, dynamic and integrative nature of SynBio and will develop a comparable ethics response.", 295485.0, 891520.0, "SYBHEL", "Controversial creation of artificial life", "Synthetic biology (SynBio) designs help build new living systems from the molecular to the organism level.

A multi-disciplinary team of experts from ethics, philosophy, theology, law, genetics, sociology, biology, biotechnology, and biochemistry have provided the first detailed analysis of the key ethical issues and the important global applications of this exciting but highly controversial field.\n\nSynBio aims to re-engineer biological processes to achieve specific targeted outcomes. As medicine aims to repair malfunctions in the body, SynBio can be harnessed to treat diseases such as cancer, antibiotic resistant infections and genetic disorders. This also includes further honing the effectiveness of the beneficial elements of the human body such as beneficial gut bacteria and the immune system.\n\nThroughout the three-year term, SYBHEL held conferences and workshops to air and disseminate the immense scope and implications of SynBio. The final conference was held in June 2012 at the British Library in London. The meeting's objective - to discuss and revise the http://sybhel.org/?p=893  (\"SYBHEL Report and Policy Recommendations\").\n\nThe report is available online along with other interesting features such as the SYBHEL short story. The project ran a competition and the result is a collection of short-listed stories available as a free kindle e-book. Readers can vote for their favourite.\n\nOther ingenious ways of opening up the forum and increasing awareness on SynBio included videos and podcasts of interviews and discussions, blogs, open days, a call for papers, discussions and a brainstorming series. The project's videos feature on the http://vimeo.com/user5259198 (Vimeo channel) and YouTube.\n\nThe examination of ethical, legal and social implications research so far has used a simplistic 'tick box' or check list approach. This reduces the whole issue to a risk assessment exercise of under analysed principles and concepts. SYBHEL recommends moving away from individual biotechnologies, frameworks and subsections.

These records, in turn, integrate the weathering signal from the continents, containing valuable information about rates of chemical weathering in the past, with links to atmospheric CO2 drawdown and long-term climate change. To date, three different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the incongruent weathering of Hf. Traditionally, it has been related to the resistance of zircons to weathering. Their retention of unradiogenic Hf, however, has been suggested to be reduced during times of intense physical weathering, indicating that Hf isotopes allow the reconstruction of the intensity of physical weathering in the past. Recently, it was suggested that the preferential release of radiogenic Hf by high lutetium/Hf silicate accessory phases controls the incongruency of Hf weathering. This implies fast temporal evolution of the released Hf isotopic compositions with soil age as these phases are easily weathered and become depleted. Lastly, there is evidence that carbonate weathering is also significant for the oceanic Hf budget. The Hf isotopic evolution of seawater in the past could thus reflect the changes in the relative weathering contributions of unradiogenic silicates and radiogenic carbonates. The research seeks to obtain a detailed understanding of the processes that control the release of Hf isotopes from the continents by studying soil chronosequences and stream waters that drain variable lithologies under variable climatic conditions.

The oscillation between glacial and interglacial periods during the Quaternary may therefore have acted to maintain low atmospheric CO2. This represents a stable mode of operation of the climate system at low temperatures.\n\nThe aim of the EU-funded HAFNIUMWEATHERING project was to gain an understanding of the release of the element Hf during chemical weathering. This enabled scientists to interpret the presence of Hf in marine sediments, which offer records of the composition of seawater in the past. These records can provide valuable information regarding past rates of chemical weathering and CO2 drawdown and of long-term climate change.\n\nResearchers studied three different hypotheses for explaining the incongruent nature of Hf weathering. The traditional explanation is that it is related to resistance by zircons (a common mineral that occurs as a small crystal) to weathering. However, it has been suggested that this is reduced during times of intense chemical weathering. Therefore, Hf isotopes can be used to reconstruct the intensity of physical weathering in the past.\n\nMore recently, it has been posited that the preferential release of Hf by Lutetium and Hf silicate controls the incongruence of Hf weathering. This infers rapid evolution of the released Hf isotopes with soil age as they are easily weathered and become depleted. Finally, there is evidence that carbonate weathering is also important in determining the level of Hf in the ocean.\n\nResults from the HAFNIUMWEATHERING project will allow a more robust interpretation of seawater Hf isotope records. This will provide a better understanding of the nature and rate of past weathering and its effect on atmospheric CO2.", null, "http://www.bristol.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/148425.jpg", "fp7_96003_999974262"], ["1TH", "Determinants of eating behaviour in European children, adolescents and their parents", "University of Bristol", "Nutrition-related diseases caused a loss of over 56 million years of healthy life of European citizens in 2000.

This makes decision-making difficult, because the best thing to do depends critically on the make-up of the social environment and the strategies others adopt. Current theory is poorly equipped to deal with these decisions because it typically assumes that individuals have perfect knowledge of the situation in which they find themselves, including the states of others with whom they interact. OBJECTIVES My project will investigate the evolution of behavioural strategies for dealing with uncertainty, focusing on aggression and mate choice. This will require an interdisciplinary approach, integrating economic concepts traditionally used in behavioural ecology with a more psychological perspective. STRATEGY To achieve this goal I will combine theory with empirical work and collaborate with world-leading researchers with the relevant expertise. In the outgoing phase, I will study aggressive behaviour in real animals to test novel predictions of my earlier models on uncertainty, running tests on captive zebra finches and examining patterns of aggression in data from humans. In the return phase, I will develop new models of mating behaviour that explicitly consider the uncertainty inherent in systems of mutual choice, using a Bayesian approach. RELEVANCE The project will considerably enhance my international, interdisciplinary research experience and train me specifically in the use of longitudinal databases for understanding behavioural development. With expert mentoring and a Personal Career Development Plan, this new knowledge and training will boost my professional development as an independent research scientist.

Metal fuels have the advantage of much higher heat conductivity compared to oxide fuels, but cannot survive equally high temperatures because of high thermal expansion.\n\nTo address this phenomenon, scientists processed a different phase structure of uranium that presents better homogeneous thermal expansion with EU funding of the project 'Uralloy' (URALLOY). The project tested uranium alloying with a range of transition metals, such as molybdenum, zirconium and tantalum. This was achieved through an entirely novel and inherently safe approach: thin-film synthesis via magnetron sputtering.\n\nThrough this process, scientists prepared polycrystals or single crystals of thin-film samples of many different binary alloy combinations. Use of a capping layer served to prevent film oxidation. The purity and perfect flatness of the thin-film samples provided a simplified model surface that can subsequently be exposed to different environmental conditions during characterisation testing. URALLOY investigated the oxidation and corrosion properties of uranium alloy fuel materials especially during interim storage and under certain waste disposal conditions.\n\nIn the case of the uranium-molybdenum system, the relatively low molybdenum content functioned as a stabilising factor of the single-phase uranium at a high temperature.

The latter focuses on one particle or entity and replaces all interactions with the other entities with an average (mean) interaction. The new method was applied to formic acid, a prototype system with weak and strong correlations.

On this approach, we treat the possible epistemic states of an agent as if they were epistemic actions between which that agent must choose; and we use so-called epistemic utility functions to measure the epistemic virtues that a particular epistemic state enjoys relative to a possible state of the world.  We then appeal to the general norms of decision theory, together with facts about the epistemic utility functions, in order to deduce epistemic norms.

The ultimate objective is to answer five fundamental questions: &quot; Why is crustal magmatism episodic? &quot; How are large batholiths formed of rather similar magmas over long periods of time? &quot; How do large bodies of eruptible magma develop that can lead to huge, caldera-forming eruptions? &quot; What controls the chemistry of crustal magmas?

In addition genetic diseases (channelopathies) associated with epilepsy, migraine and dementia have been linked to specific mutations in Kv channels. Fundamental research into channels is essential because nearly a third of new therapeutic interventions target channels. Part of the reason for this is the diversity of channel types allowing a large number of targets each with relatively restricted expression and specific control of a particular excitable process. Modulation of Kv channels offers the opportunity to control conditions involving circuit level defects in excitability such as epilepsy, migraine, dementia and depression. Not surprisingly drugs of abuse target channels, therefore this research is hoped to give mechanistic insight into addiction.  I wish to determine the role of Kv channels and modulators in mechanisms of plasticity underlying learning in the model system Drosophila. I will address this by genetically removing candidate Kv channels and determining the effect on learning and memory, which is thought to involve modulation of Kv channels.

The EU-funded 'Kv channels & memory' project is investigating learning in drosophila, also known as the common fruit fly. In cell biology 'Kv channels' stands for voltage-gated potassium channels - mechanisms and areas that play a role in how neurons in the brain fire at each other or communicate.

Specific stocks of drosophila are thus being 'mutated' for each type of Kv channel related to different parts of the insect (antenna lobe, mushroom body, etc). The project is identifying and establishing these in order to examine neuronal and synaptic changes.\n\nThese changes are being recorded in parallel with behavioural changes, a process which is identifying specific Kv channels that are implicated in learning and memory.\n\nThe research is set to yield important insight into memory and learning in fruit flies, with results that can then be transposed on to humans.

In order to understand the evolution of mechanisms, we need a fundamental change in the sort of models that are analysed.

These arise because a notion of optimization, or maximization, is central to both bodies of theory. Evolutionary biologists typically assume that because of natural selection, animals will behave as if they are trying to maximize their Darwinian fitness (for some appropriate measure of fitness). This is the guiding assumption in much work on animal behaviour. Rational choice theorists typically assume that humans will behave as if they are trying to maximize a utility function. This is the guiding assumption in much work in social science. Thus there is a close parallel between the notion of fitness in evolutionary theory and the notion of utility in the theory of rationality.

Understanding these processes for therapeutic intervention has so far focused on identification of the factors involved, their structures, and the interactions between them. However, given that membrane-abcission is the key event in all these processes, the mechanics of membrane scission cannot be neglected. Due to fast and highly localised transformations, protein mediated membrane remodelling in general has proven difficult for quantitative mechanistic scrutiny (perhaps with the single exception of dynamin which, unlike the ESCRT-III, acts from the outside of a membrane neck). In humans ESCRT-III members are called CHMPs. Major advances have been recently made in (i) determination of polymeric structures formed by human (yeast) CHMP4 (Snf7), CHMP3 (vps24) and CHMP2A; (ii) membrane splitting activity has been attributed to the sequential binding of the yeast proteins vps20 (CHMP6), Snf7 and vps24, (iii) vps2 (CHMP2), which binds vps24, recruits a AAA ATPAse vps4 which then recycles the membrane bound ESCRT-III.  Several models have since been proposed where protein polymers constricting the membrane neck for fission is the common theme. However, there is considerable debate over the essential molecular mechanism of the process. Therefore, I will address: 1. How do CHMP2, 3, 4 and 6 assemblies form on membranes and dissociate in a VPS4 dependent manner? 2. What are the structures, composition and direction of growth of ESCRT-III assemblies as they mature on lipid membranes? 3. Since ESCRT-III polymer must form through the central pore of a membrane tubule, thereby posing a steric hindrance for fusion, how does pore closure followed by scission take place? 4. As CHMPs are predominantly cytosolic, how do their binding partners such as VPS4, AMSH (deubiquitin isopeptidase), and Alix (adaptor molecule) get selectively targeted to the membrane-bound fraction of CHMPs to exert their membrane proximal function?\nAnswering the posed questions will not only advance our understanding of HIV egress from cells, it may also help open new therapeutic intervention points for several ESCRT-III related dysfunction.

Specifically, my goal is to show that synaptic kainate receptors (KARs) are regulated in an activity-dependent manner that involves their SUMOylation. Recently, Mellor and Henley have discovered that the KAR subunit GluR6 is a substrate for SUMO and that SUMOylation of GluR6 causes KARs to be endocytosed. This was demonstrated for synaptic KARs at mossy fibre synapses in the hippocampus, suggesting that it is a mechanism for activity-dependent regulation of KARs at this synapse. In the post-synaptic density, PDZ-domain-containing proteins play a prominent role in organizing synaptic elements. My hypothesis is that SUMOylation of GluR6 influences the interaction of KARs with PDZ binding proteins, thus leading to KAR plasticity. In addition, phosphorylation of GluR6 by protein kinase C (PKC) could potentially regulate SUMOylation itself. To test these hypotheses, I intend to employ electrophysiological techniques (patch-clamp recording) in acute and cultured thalamocortical and hippocampal slices, combining them with biochemical techniques to block specific protein-protein interactions and modulate the level of GluR6 SUMOylation.

Furthermore, by variation of the reagents and their stereochemistry any compound and any stereoisomer will be accessible thus allowing diversity elements to be introduced without additional cost.

Our method involves initially generating a nucleophile (bearing a group that also leaves during the course of the reaction) (an organometallic reagent) and reacting it with another nucleophile (an organometallic reagent) to create a new chiral organometallic. We believe that reactions of this class of nucleophiles with conventional and non- conventional electrophiles will open up a whole new area of synthesis and provide a step change in asymmetric synthesis that could have far reaching consequences.

Proper DNA-end processing and handling are essential for the survival of the cell and prevention of carcinogenesis. Cells possess robust mechanisms to repair DNA breaks. One such DNA repair mechanism is homologous recombination where the sister chromatid is used as a template for the faithful repair of the DNA break. In Bacteria, this pathway is initiated when a DNA end is processed to a 3\uf0a2-ssDNA overhang terminated at a recombination hotspot (Chi) sequence. This is a substrate for formation of a RecA nucleoprotein filament that catalyses strand exchange to promote repair. Recent data implicate the AddAB helicase-nuclease and the SMC (Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes) complex in the DNA break processing mechanism of the model organism Bacillus subtilis.

The recent successes of \u201cdeep\u201d networks make this issue topical for psychology and neuroscience, and it raises the question of whether symbols are needed for artificial intelligence more generally.\n\nOne of the innovations of the current project is to identify simple empirical phenomena that will serve a critical test-bed for both symbolic and non-symbolic neural networks. In order to make substantial progress on this issue a series of empirical and computational investigations are organised as follows.  First, studies focus on tasks that, according to proponents of symbolic systems, require symbols for the sake of generalisation. Accordingly, if non-symbolic networks succeed, it would undermine one of the main motivations for symbolic systems.  Second, studies focus on generalisation in tasks in which human performance is well characterised. Accordingly, the research will provide important constraints for theories of cognition across a range of domains, including vision, memory, and reasoning.  Third, studies develop new learning algorithms designed to make symbolic systems biologically plausible.  One of the reasons why symbolic networks are often dismissed is the claim that they are not as biologically plausible as non-symbolic models.

This connects the extreme value statistics of the characteristic polynomials of random matrices asymptotically to those of the Gaussian fields in question, allowing some important and long-standing open questions to be addressed for the first time.

My aim is to attack some of these problems using ideas and techniques that have so far not been applied to them: I believe it is possible to compute some important statistical quantities relating to the extreme values of characteristic polynomials exactly, for the first time, by establishing connections with integrable systems, representation theory, and enumerative combinatorics.

There is a poor understanding of the character of herd animal husbandry strategies that were central to pastoralist subsistence and how these co-evolved alongside pastoralist dietary intake and ritual use of herd animals. We have a remarkably poor understanding of what pastoralists ate, especially the dietary contribution of dairy products - the quintessential dietary cornerstone food of pastoralist societies. \n\nASIAPAST addresses these gaps through a biomolecular approach that recovers the dietary and mobility histories of pastoralists and their animals recorded in bones, teeth, and pottery.

With current concerns about biodiversity and conservation effort, it is essential to understand why some species are more prone to extinction than others which requires an understanding of all aspects of their biology. The dodo was the largest terrestrial animal in its ecosystem. Understanding of its ecology is therefore crucial to understand the Mauritius ecosystem before the arrival of humans, and to estimate the real impact of human activity on this island.

Starting from the observation that the properties of water seem to appear fine-tuned, we are going to 'untune' water's interactions. This means that we are going to consider the interactions of water as one point in a higher dimensional space of possible interactions, and we are going to study how the properties of water change going from \u201creal\u201d water to models which behave like other simple liquids. This continuous change will allow us not only to understand the unique properties that are found in water, but will also provide a route to the potential discovery of new behaviour that cannot be captured with conventional approaches.\n\nThe process of gradually changing the interactions in water produces a family of models that we call 'Soft Water', and in this research proposal we are going to show how this new approach has the potential to solve the mysteries that real water is still hiding from us.", 829911.0, 829911.0, "SOFTWATER", null, null, null, null, "http://www.bristol.ac.uk", null, "h2020_212115_999974262"], ["1TH", "Aircraft noise Reduction Technologies and related Environmental iMpact", "University of Bristol", "With ARTEM (Aircraft noise Reduction Technologies and related Environmental iMpact), seven EREA members and strategic partners have teamed up with leading European universities and major entities of the European aerospace industry in order to address the technology challenges raised in the call MG-1-2-2017 \u201cReducing aviation noise\u201d.

Equally importantly, the in-situ characterisation for specific inspections will provide the confidence needed to make safe decisions from measured indications without the significant conservatism that is needed in many cases currently. \nADVISE brings together leading experts and key stakeholders with long-term commitments to this subject, covering construction, operation, and all aspects of in-service inspection.

I propose to track information flow through a natural group using brain gene expression profiles, to understand how dances elicit learning in the bee brain. Secondly, although bee foraging ranges are vast and diverse, social learning takes place in one centralized location (the hive). The social sciences now offer powerful new tools to analyze social networks, and I will use a cutting-edge network-based modelling approach to understand how the importance of social learning mechanisms shifts with ecology.

At present industry typically uses the linear doublet lattice method with static loads corrections from expensive wind tunnel data. The wind tunnel data is created using the final aerodynamic surface in the predicted cruise shape. This means that gust loads come relatively late when the design options have been narrowed. Increased competition and environmental concerns are likely to lead to the adoption of more flexible materials and the consideration of novel configurations, in which case the linear assumptions of the current gust loads process will become unacceptable.  To introduce non-linearity into the gust loads process without significantly increasing the cost and time, this project has three main objectives: to carry out investigations using CFD so that the non-linearities in gust interactions are understood; to create a gust loads process that does not require wind tunnel data and hence reduces the need for wind tunnel testing; to develop updated reduced order models for gust prediction that account for non-linearity at an acceptable cost. These investigations will reduce the need for expensive wind tunnel testing and hence lead to time and cost savings at the design stage therefore ensuring that the European aerospace and defence industry remain competitive in the future.

In this respect, the figure of the young Italian man functions as a multi-faceted trope that challenges the patriarchal values embodied by older men. Secondly, that there has been a lack of studies of Italian cinematic masculinity, especially in the postwar period. From this perspective, the project intends to complement existing work in the fields of history and sociology on the emergence of Italian youth culture; it will uncover the repertoire of young masculine identities that cinema offered to audiences in these years, which were crucial to the negotiation of changing gender roles in the Italian cultural imaginary after the WWII until the present. \nThe project is organised according to an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to the cinematic apparatus.

The two modules, the intermediate project and the final project were duly coordinated, so that the training received in the intensive courses was necessary for the preparation of the intermediate project, for the mathematical modeling workshops associated with each intensive course and for the development of the final project.

All of\r\nthe partners in the consortium have broad and complementary experience, as well as operational and managerial competences in\r\nthe areas of project management and quality assurance. The current configuration of the consortium ensures not only that skills are\r\ncomplementary in the areas involved in the project, but in addition fully embraces the diversity of the situations in Europe since it\r\nincludes countries from southern Europe, severely affected by the current financial crisis (Italy, Portugal and Spain), countries in northern Europe (Finland and UK) and in eastern Europe (Romania).\r\n\r\nMethodology, short description of results, impact and long-term benefits:\r\nCarrying out a deep analysis of the different understandings of vulnerable groups and non-traditional students in Europe, identifying good practices, developing a strategic plan model for equitable access and success in Higher Education and creating a\r\nLaboratory for Policies and Practices of Social Development in Higher Education to disseminate the results and to raise the awareness of the subject matter, the project will enable the access and exchange of numerous policies and initiatives that the partners are already developing in order to improve access to and permanence in HE for vulnerable collectives and non-traditional learners. The desired impact at both local and international levels is double: (1)increase recognition, equity and inclusion of\r\nvulnerable groups in European HEIs; and (2)to improve the quality and to increase the volume of multilateral cooperation between\r\nhigher education institutes in Europe, creating a network of HEIs interested in the development of the social dimension of the EHEA.", "http://www.bristol.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA203-015970_4"], ["1TH", "Novel Approach: Transnational Postgraduate Education and Training Programme in Musculoskeletal Regenerative Research", "UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL", 221693.0, "In this project, Yildirim Beyazit University, University of Utrecht, University of Bristol, Heidelberg University and Institute of Rizzoli will participate for establishing a network between high quality researchers both in basic and clinical sciences in musculoskeletal education and trainining (for third cycle degree education) for medical doctors and basic scientists in order to provide  high quality in musculoskeletal regenerative medicine in the application of  innovative approaches.It is required to create a network in musculoskeletal regenerative research for generating innovative approaches and bench to bed side applications for diagnosis and treatment to satisfy the needs of clinical orthopaedic practices in regenerative medicine.The overall objectives of the project is to support the cooperation between European Higher Education Institutions in musculoskeletal regenerative medicine research through developing and conveying knowledge of Research & Development (R&D). In the project, all common shared scientific and educational ideas will be considered as a significant asset for developing better diagnostics and more effective treatments in the musculoskeletal diseases.\r\nThe project will share  the ideas by meetings, symposia, webinars, pilot site visits, project website and workshops. All partners will contribute to workshops and meetings. Meetings (2 days), Work package meetings (2 Days) ,Workshops (2 days) and Webinars will be held periodically. Cultural trips will be organised range from 1 day to 2 days. All the project participants will be involved in all activities.\r\nThe Objectives of The Projects is described as it follows:\r\nTo promote networking, good practice in research on musculoskeletal regenerative medicine; stimulate dialogue for  post graduate education and training practices to develop innovative diagnostic and therapeutical tools, \r\nTo identify and raise awareness on the key framework issues (particularly in multidisciplinary studies) of cross-border research collaboration and knowledge transfer in EU countries, \r\nTo provide practical support for research collaboration and for long distance learning by webinars and teaching modules part of PhD education programmes through creating and running a web portal which allows identifying cross-border collaboration aspects, legal frameworks and good practice.\r\nThe projects also aims to improve language and social skills and competences , organisational skills and competences.\r\nTarget groups of the project are students, scholars, researchers and medical doctors in musculoskeletal regenerative medicine field from neighbouring countries.The project will increase transnational communication in higher education institutions involved in innovative research and education on musculoskeletal regenerative medicine in Europe and neighbouring countries via personal contacts to networks of projects participants, international meetings, conferences, seminars, webinars. \r\nFinal beneficiaries comprise: any research based organisations and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and individuals potentially participating in cross border research collaboration projects or research staff exchange, including HEIs and, enterprises (Industry).

Funding programmes are increasingly competitive, with a greater focus on excellence, the need to do more in partnerships with other institutions and companies, and the need to demonstrate research impact, efficiency, and innovation throughout. Skilled research managers are key players in institutional efforts to sustain and grow research and are critical enablers in helping research projects achieve maximum deliverables and impact.To address this challenge we will develop a professionalisation route for research managers and administrators (RMAs) in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. This will be achieved through a number of outputs, including the development of a certification course for RMAs, the establishment of accreditation mechanism for RMA professionals which is aligned with current international practices, the development of a Masters in RMA curriculum for future post-graduate qualification, and an information and staff exchange, and mentorship programme, to promote capacity development, mutual understanding and cooperation.  This programme will have a catalytic effect on institutional research capacity and hence research outputs and outcomes. It will, amongst other things, promote and facilitate the ability to lead, participate in and obtain funding for high quality and original scholarship, knowledge generation and impact. This has a beneficial effect on the reputation of a university and its partners.

The primary aim of the project is therefore for the JMC to create a focal point for such collaboration. This will entail the creation by the JMC of a Bristol European Studies Network; and the use of this network to develop new teaching and research initiatives, both within the framework of this project and beyond it. As well as developing teaching and research capacity at Bristol, the JMC will, through the support provided, initiate new links with local policy-makers and civil servants, as well as with local civil society, schoolteachers and the general public; it will establish new contacts with national policy-makers; and will develop relationships between Bristol and the international academic community, with a particular emphasis on East Asian scholars working on Europe. The substantive focus of the project is post-crisis Europe, with a particular focus on (a) the emergence of new thinking on EU governance and EU politics since 2008; and (b) the debate on the future of the UK\u2019s role in Europe.
