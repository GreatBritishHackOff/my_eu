This is counter balanced with the increases in learners wanting to undertake adult learning provision centered around arts and crafts.  These issues have led to us seeking to submit this project for funding \r\n\r\nParticipants will be made up of adult/trainers educators  from across the UK and be actively involved in supporting hard to reach and disadvantaged learners. They will also be interested in developing adult social enterprises. This project is a direct result of learner, trainer and partner demand. \r\n\r\nThe project duration abroad will be 8 days per flow. The course will be over a 6 day period,  include cultural activities and 2 day for travel. This period appears to be sufficient for our trainers, as a comprehensive agenda for the Training Course will be prepared. The reason why the placement is not any longer is because family and work commitment for our trainers and limited resources to cover staff replacement costs. Also partners can only provide a 6 day training course without increasing costs substantially.\r\n\r\nEach one over the flows will be planned and managed over a 6 month period, the 24 month project will have a flow organised every 6 months with a degree of flexibility (from recruitment to dissemination and evaluation/ impact phase of each flow).\r\n\r\nThe project is pertinent to the needs of our trainers and this is evidenced by the learning that has been already been acquired and that is being examined here in the Birmingham. There is a real demand for this tailored course from trainers and local partners. \r\n\r\nWe seek to examine  how art and crafts based  adult education methodologies that being  used and the value that they can add to our clients.  For this reason we  need as many trainers to experience this learning as possible in order to challenge conceptions and develop provision that is more responsive to client needs.\r\n\r\nOur organisation and partners have limited staff training budgets and by using Erasmas+ KA1 AE Mobility will enable us to equip our trainers with new skills, new ways of working and higher levels of motivation to support disadvantaged learners. Without this project we would not be able to improve our Adult education policies, practices and test the quality of our services. The project will examine and test adult education methodologies used around the engagement, support and advancement of adult learners, who are bound by traditions, culture and families. We will also examine how SE worked within this context.  \r\n\r\nThis project  is needed and resubmitted because of the:\r\n1) demand / number of applications for places on the training programme is high\r\n2) impact of learning on trainers and their CPD as been immense\r\n3) way in which partner organisations have started to shape their adult learning provision to better meet the needs of learners (for instance we have in the UK seen trainers using crafts skills to engage and work with women offenders  in order to begin to address their needs rather than just talk to then in a classroom.\r\n4) level of interest in developing arts and crafts based social enterprises.\r\n\r\nOur objectives are: \r\n-Train 40 adult educators in the use of arts and crafts methodologies that include, activities, learner engagement, empowerment, enterprise, social cohesion\r\n-Enable  trainers to reflect on practice and implement positive changes in adult education \r\n-The development of organisational learning opportunities \r\n-Sharing learning and best practice \r\n-Helping us to meet our organisational development priorities (EDP)\r\n\r\nPlease note that we are aware of the difficulties in Turkey and those issues will be tackled with the advice of the NA and the FCO, We didnt want to abandon our work or our partner in Turkey because things have become more tense.

Surely, these issues could be tackled by more cycling, which is still not popular enough in some of the countries. With this in mind, youth organizations from Italy, Poland, Spain, Lithuania, UK and Denmark have united for this project with the aim to make cycling more popular as a mean of healthy, cheap & sustainable transport. To reach the aim, a youth exchange - Cycle & the City will be hosted in Lithuania on September 4 - 10, 2017 (+a 2-day APV in August). It will involve 36 open-minded youngsters (18-30 years old) willing to change cycling culture in Europe.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\nTo achieve this aim, the following objectives were set: (1) promote cycling as a means of transport both for leisure and work, and the health benefits that come along; (2) lobby for the maintenance of a safe, convenient, efficient and accessible cycling network in participating regions; (3) reduce the actual and perceived dangers faced by cyclists; and (4) appeal to drivers to respect bikes on the road.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES:\r\nA number of activities have been planned in order to help fulfill the project objectives, which include 1) interactive workshops on cycling initiatives, and the benefits they bring; 2) discussions on cycling as a mean of transport in non-formal environment; 3) assessing cycling routes and bicycle rental points in the cities to propose strategical actions to the local municipalities; 4) interactive sessions with experts on cycling, healthy-lifestyle, and public route planning;  5) creative art sessions on the topic;  6) cycling events: critical mass, games for kids, info sessions in the city;  7) visit to local municipality to propose cycling initiatives, 8) analysis of relevant video materials, and much more.\r\n\r\nSince the project goal is to reach the public and disseminate the results effectively participants will: \r\n- prepare an e-booklet focusing on the ways to promote cycling to youth;\r\n- create open cycling events in Kaunas, where participants would engage the public to various activities; \r\n- share good cycling practices from Denmark, UK and Valencia to the public and local decision makers;\r\n- use social media, press and other on-line tools to deliver results further.\r\n\r\nThis will ensure that the project would induce a positive effect on the participants, organisations and the target groups (young people, youth workers, local authorities and the wider public) in regional, national and international levels.\r\n\r\nIMPACT TO PARTICIPANTS:\r\nParticipating youth will learn about cycling activities across Europe, including the ways they are organized and maintained. They will also gather all the necessary knowledge needed for responsible and safe cycling. On top of that, they will learn more about healthy lifestyle and other positive aspects associated with cycling. This will be a base for them in eventually becoming \"Cycling Ambassadors\" in their countries. \r\n\r\nAll the participants will also learn how to effectively communicate in team (as most of the activities will require teamwork). They will also acquire the knowledge and experience needed to: 1) generate ideas; and then 2) create and implement public cycling and sports initiatives. This includes: their understanding of the key organizational things, including vision and mission, values, long-term strategy, marketing, public relations, budget and financing. The participants will learn how to attract the necessary investments for social activities and what are the EU laws for setting up an initiative. Our anticipation is that all this learning will make them self-sufficient in any future endeavors (not just cycling).\r\n\r\nFURTHER IMPACT:\r\nThe project is anticipated to not only help participating youth enhance their skills and competences, but also increase general awareness of the urban cycling culture in participating countries. The essential lasting impact of the project will be the necessary positive policy changes on cycling  that could be made as a result of participant interaction with and suggestions to policy makers. We believe that this will help increase the usage of bicycles as a mean of transport in all the project countries.", "http://www.praxiseurope.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-LT02-KA105-005470_3"], ["7BH", "Prove Them Wrong", "PRAXIS EUROPE CIC", 17155.0, "There are numerous challenges that European societies are facing. One of the sensitive problems that is widely seen in every EU country that millions of juveniles are arrested on charges ranging from minor status offences, such as theft, to such serious crimes such as burglary, robbery, rape, road traffic offences, violence against person, homicide etc. Afterwards they more often than not face social exclusion are very limited future prospects, which leads them back to crime. The organizations that united for this project believe that there is still a lack of methods in youth work which can help young people prevent from re-offending; and that everyone should have the opportunity to make solutions in similar situations and find a place back into society. \r\n\r\nTo reach this aim, youth exchange - \u201cProve Them Wrong\u201d will be hosted in Lithuania. It will involve 36 participants both non-criminals and ex-criminals (18-30 years old).

Presenting the plants to others for discussions & improvements;\r\n\r\n6)Social actions in the city aimed at fighting the stereotypes of young offenders and facilitating social inclusion (+ making special videos on that); inviting media to cover this. This will also help disseminate the ideas and message of the project locally;\r\n\r\n7)Preparation of result dissemination plan and creating means for that (e.g. e-booklet); project wrap-up - participants will write their after-project knowledge, set a plan for the future.\r\n\r\nThe participants will not only improve their skills and competences required for reducing social exclusion, but they will also learn to: \r\n- Acquire and improve many skills and competences required for reducing stereotypes towards young criminals and resulting social exclusion (discussed above);\r\n- Understand what stereotypes about young offenders are there around Europe, what impact of those stereotypes is for the receiving party and on the population;\r\n- Comprehend the importance of tolerance and equality in the society;\r\n- Get knowledge of the most common offences committed by young people and the characteristic of young offender.\r\n\r\nThis will help the young participants to create methods how to prevent young people from re-offending and how to help them to get back to the society after committed a first crime.

We will establish this by showing Islam\u2019s with its all beauty and discovering similarities and common points with Christianity and Judaism. We think that raising awareness among religions will be effective in breaking prejudice towards different religions. We prepared our activity schedule by using activities which everyone will enjoy and common learning methods which will give the participants the chance of participating actively.\r\n\r\nWe will enable representing different important religions in partnering countries by creating a model of the religious and historical landmarks. We will give a place on each of the models for both a disclaimer for the landmark and various historical and religious people, books and idioms encouraging tolerance. Common point of the messages will be that all individuals who think differently or from different religions convey the same message.\r\n\r\nIn our town there will also be a religious or historical character that each participant represents. Our purpose is again, to raise awareness that no matter how distant from each other, actually they have many similarities. Each participant will study the characters they choose in details and they will make a costume to represent it thanks to the recycling activity that each participant will carry out by using old clothes. By coinciding our final activity with the candy feast following Ramadan, we will try to let our participants make them feel a festival which belongs to Islam and make a connection between their festivals and Eid al-Fitr.
