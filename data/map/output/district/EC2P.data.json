Making the infrastructures \u201csmarter\u201d usually means making them smarter in normal operation and use: more adaptive, more intelligent\u2026 But will these smart critical infrastructures (SCIs) behave equally \u201csmartly\u201d and be \u201csmartly resilient\u201d also when exposed to extreme threats, such as extreme weather disasters or terrorist attacks? If making existing infrastructure \u201csmarter\u201d is achieved by making it more complex, would it also make it more vulnerable? Would this affect resilience of an SCI as its ability to anticipate, prepare for, adapt and withstand, respond to, and recover?\nThese are the main questions tackled by this proposal.\nThe proposal envisages answering the above questions in several steps. (#1) By identifying existing indicators suitable for assessing resilience of SCIs. (#2) By identifying new \u201csmart\u201d resilience indicators (RIs) \u2013 including those from Big Data. (#3) By developing a new advanced resilience assessment methodology (TRL4) based on smart RIs (\u201cresilience indicators cube\u201d, including the resilience matrix). (#4) By developing the interactive \u201cSCI Dashboard\u201d tool. (#5) By applying the methodology/tools in 8 case studies, integrated under one virtual, smart-city-like, European case study. The SCIs considered (in 8 European countries!) deal with energy, transportation, health, water\u2026\nResults #2, #3, #4 and #5 are a breakthrough innovation.\nThis approach will allow benchmarking the best-practice solutions and identifying the early warnings, improving resilience of SCIs against new threats and cascading and ripple effects. The benefits/savings to be achieved by the project will be assessed by the reinsurance company participant.
