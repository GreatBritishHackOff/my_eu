With this device agencies charged with tackling the growing menace of the trafficking in counterfeit medicines will be able to screen packaged pharmaceuticals at EU borders and airports quickly and accurately using a non-invasive and non-destructive technology that uses only harmless radio waves.\n\nThe proposal is for a three-year programme leading to the trialing of a prototype, portable, handheld scanner, that will draw on the expertise of seven organisations in five states, including two recent additions to the EU family, Poland and Slovenia.  The technology employed will be based on quadrupole resonance (QR), a radiofrequency (RF) spectroscopic technique that has already been developed and deployed for the detection of concealed explosives.   The completed prototype will not require operators to have special chemical or technical knowledge to deploy it, allowing training in its use to be completed quickly; and it will utilise only easy to source RF and electrical parts, unlike alternative technologies such as Raman, infra-red or terahertz spectroscopic methods.  It will also offer a clear advantage over these other technologies in that RF can penetrate even multiple layers of packaging material, allowing for scans to be carried out without the need to remove pharmaceutical products from their packaging.", 37876.0, 2989817.0, "CONPHIRMER", "Counterfeit drugs detection device", "Globalisation has opened up markets, but this has also increased problems with regard to preventing the marketing of counterfeit goods, particularly medicines.

QR technology will utilise radio frequency (RF) to excite and detect specific atoms such as the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) present in genuine drugs. \n\nResearchers drew up a protocol to develop a database of frequently counterfeited medicines such as sildenafil and orlistat along with their QR fingerprints based on APIs. For testing purposes and QR development, paracetamol was chosen due to its wide availability in different formulations and packaging as well as low cost. \n\nCorrelating QR responses to a particular drug requires a comprehensive characterisation of the QR responses of different APIs. Researchers compared the QR responses of several medicines with different APIs using multiple RF pulse sequences. These were monitored in a time-specific manner and their frequency response, as well as intensity were determined. \n\nSimultaneously, scientists worked on developing better second-generation detection and classification algorithms based on first-generation techniques.\n\nThe computational capacity and interference cancellation of current algorithms were optimised. However, work is ongoing to further optimise noise reduction and improve signal processing capabilities for testing experimental data. \n\nScientists successfully demonstrated a laboratory-based proof-of-concept for each aspect of the QR-based medicines authentication system, but the prototype development is in initial stages. To reduce device complexity, size and weight, scientists are also working on reducing RF excitation power for QR tests. \n\nThe final portable, battery-powered device prototype will contain a handheld antenna to capture QR signals from medicines. The main part of the device will contain the RF spectrometer, RF power amplifier and computer control. \n\nSuccessful development and commercialisation of this QR spectrometer prototype will enable the non-invasive and non-destructive testing of medicines while they are in their packaging.

Tempering is critical for reducing processing failures and ensuring a quality end product. Incorrect tempering makes the chocolate  become dull, susceptible to fat bloom, soft in texture and \u2018warm\u2019 in the mouth, as well as difficult to demould with a greater probability of mould marks on the surface. Tempering is a highly complex process, affected by many raw material and processing factors, whereby the specific tempering conditions required will depend on the cocoa butter used, the type of product being made and the subsequent processing. Few solutions exist for controlling the tempering process of chocolate.\nSolid Fat Content (SFC), the generally accepted analysis of fats and oils in the food industry, is crucial to the texture of chocolate. As SFC may change during manufacturing and storage, it is important to be able to measure this parameter to control the ingredients and manufacturing conditions for achieving optimum product quality. Traditional methods of SFC determination are slow, irreproducible, require additional chemicals and are based on sampling. An in-line sensor capable of measuring the SFC in the chocolate melt would allow automated control of the tempering process and would be of great value to manufacturers.\nUltrasonics is a popular technique for understanding phase transitions as the acoustic properties of solids and liquids are so different that changes are easy to measure. Two possible methods for controlling the tempering process will be explored based on the use of ultrasound: a novel technology to control the crystal size distribution during tempering, and development of an in-line sensor capable of measuring the SFC, crystal size distribution and polymorph distribution in the melt.
