The project\u2019s participants are 14 youngsters from Vantaa, Finland and 14 youngsters from Kent, England. All youngsters are part of their respective area\u2019s youth councils. As a common goal of the participants, is to share proven ways to prevent discrimination and promote inclusion, all the while learning new things as individuals. Activities are planned to be versatile and inclusive, with the goal being on activating participants thinking about the theme of the project and so while the project proceeds, hopefully make it possible for the participants self-knowledge to improve, without forgetting to have fun. For the most part the project will be held in the Kukonnotko campsite. Another goal for the project is that the youngsters would learn to think more widely about the theme of discrimination and inclusion, and also for them to gain some international experience. After the project, the youngsters return to their home-countries and use what they have learned in their roles as members of their respective youth councils. Furthermore, what is learned, will be shared in newspapers, social media and from person to person. Leaving the project with one positive experience richer, the youngsters will encourage their friends and associates to start international projects of their own.", "http://www.kent.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA105-034409_1"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1XX", "Foreign Inward Investment Kent", "Kent County Council", "Led by Kent County Council and delivered in collaboration with a competitively procured contractor, this 36 month (May 2016 \u2013 April 2019) \u00a33.489m project will attract and support high value, high technology, leading edge and high growth UK and foreign inwardly investing SMEs, creating 350 new high quality jobs, helping existing overseas investors to expand their operations and working with UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) as a partner both in the UK and through its global network.
