In such situations, Collaborative Crisis Management (CCM) is usually coordinated by local authorities or dedicated civil protection organisations, supported by a variety of different national and international crisis management organisations, all acting relatively autonomously. The process is typically coordinated through periodic physical meetings of the involved organisations, in which information is shared about the situation, priorities are set and responsibilities allocated.
