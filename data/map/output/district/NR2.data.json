The conceptual stage of the design process is mainly focused on ideas generation, which are evaluated against general requirements. Distributed collaborative design is a complex process, and the lack of computer support tools in the field makes it difficult for Small to Medium Enterprise (SME's) businesses, to bring new products to market, on time and survive market competition. There is a great need for seamlessly integrating product development processes, into a comprehensive collaborative design environment, that could assist professional product designers when distributed during the early stages of the design process, to innovate, and shorten product development life-cycle.The scope of this proposal is the implementation of a semantically driven collaboration framework to be integrated into future synchronous/asynchronous collaborative design environments, dedicated to assist professional product designers when distributed during the early stages of the design process.  A number of research and technological challenges will be addressed, including the semantic integration of collaborative tools and data, effective methods for communication and interaction among distributed teams, group awareness and the use of metaphors for conceptual design; which have unique considerations and applications during early-stage product design.", 211741.0, 3561249.0, "COnCEPT", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110224_928225593"], ["3HT", "Synthetic biology \u2013 Engaging with New and Emerging Science and Technology in Responsible Governance of the Science and Society Relationship", "Rowe Eugene John - Gene Rowe Evaluations", "Synthetic biology (SynBio) offers huge potential for applications in energy, health and the environment.

In particular Rud wishes to acquire a better understanding of differing educational approaches both in kindergarten and youth clubs. In the UK children start school at the age of 5 \u2013 how does this influence approaches to education at YC and CCN compared to Norway? The development of relationships amongst the children and young people themselves is also a central theme, considering how often different cultures are involved. What can we learn from YC and CCN in relation to this, how much are the children and young people encouraged to participate themselves, and how, is bullying dealt with? In addition we would also like to prepare the ground for cooperating with UtNord in the areas of TIP and EF.

This allows both the sending and the receiving school one the opportunity to develop teaching methods that provide the groundwork for stronger bonds between our two schools. After passing all modules the students will take an interdisciplinary test. Teachers from both Norway and England will be present. The teachers have developed a much improved understanding of vocational thinking though this international cooperation.
