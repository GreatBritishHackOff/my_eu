The conceptual stage of the design process is mainly focused on ideas generation, which are evaluated against general requirements. Distributed collaborative design is a complex process, and the lack of computer support tools in the field makes it difficult for Small to Medium Enterprise (SME's) businesses, to bring new products to market, on time and survive market competition. There is a great need for seamlessly integrating product development processes, into a comprehensive collaborative design environment, that could assist professional product designers when distributed during the early stages of the design process, to innovate, and shorten product development life-cycle.The scope of this proposal is the implementation of a semantically driven collaboration framework to be integrated into future synchronous/asynchronous collaborative design environments, dedicated to assist professional product designers when distributed during the early stages of the design process.  A number of research and technological challenges will be addressed, including the semantic integration of collaborative tools and data, effective methods for communication and interaction among distributed teams, group awareness and the use of metaphors for conceptual design; which have unique considerations and applications during early-stage product design.", 211741.0, 3561249.0, "COnCEPT", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110224_928225593"], ["3HT", "Synthetic biology \u2013 Engaging with New and Emerging Science and Technology in Responsible Governance of the Science and Society Relationship", "Rowe Eugene John - Gene Rowe Evaluations", "Synthetic biology (SynBio) offers huge potential for applications in energy, health and the environment.

Also an insufficient nutrient supply in subgroups of the populations and special demands in ageing societies are identified as abiding challenges. Attempts to increase public awareness of appropriate ways to eat more healthily though do not seem to have led to significant changes in patterns of food purchase and consumption. It has become obvious that the development of effective measures for improvement is a demanding task and requires further systematic research and innovative approaches. One main question that this research needs to tackle is the role that innovations in foods (e.g. improved nutrient preservation through the use of mild pathogen inactivation) and new basic research technologies (e.g. for gaining greater insight and understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of food intake on health) could play in counter-acting the alarming rise of food-related health problems. Advocating and promoting the production of knowledge that is close to the concerns of European citizens the European Commission has emphasized that simply inventing new technologies is not enough to overcome the pressing societal challenges in Europe (European Commission 2009).
