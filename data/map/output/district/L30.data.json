It is conducted by El Pilar Salesian School. This is a school with 1200 students and 90 teachers. We teach Kindergarten, Primary, Secondary, Vocational Training and Higher Education students. \r\n\r\nThe Project is part of the plans for improving the quality of education and innovation of the school . The aims of the Project are to improve teachers\u2019 training and to provide them with innovative methodologies, ICT tools and new approaches for teaching languages. \r\n\r\nThe project involves the participation of 17 teachers from the school from all educational stages in different training actions, both in the three job visits (job-shadowing) and the five structured courses that we will perform.\r\nJob-Shadowings will be done in associated schools placed in Italy, Germany and United Kingdom. There will be eight teachers involved in these visits which are focused in direct observation about different topics:\r\n- The use of active methodologies in class (Flipped Classroom in CNOS-FAP, Italy).\r\n- Language teaching (CLIL methodology and multilingual project in Helene-Lange Realschule, Germany)\r\n- Subject specialization (Business School in Savio College, UK).\r\n\r\nStructured Courses are focused on the different areas of improvement that were detected while analysing the developmental needs of the school. There will be nine teachers participating in these structured courses:\r\n- \"Structured Visit to Schools in Finland\" This course is about  school organization and active methodologies in the Finnish education system including the Kyva program against bullying.\r\n- \u201cNumicon\u201d course works on manipulative Maths teaching in Key Stage 1 & 2.\r\n- \u201cCreative use of Technology\u201d and \u201cIntegrating ICT in teaching\u201d courses try to provide teachers the apps and knowledge they need to use ICT properly in their classes.\r\n- \u201cMontessori Educational Methodologies\u201d course is thought to help teachers to implement this methodology in their schools. \r\n\r\nWe hope that all these training actions will improve the quality of teaching in our center and make it a benchmark in innovation in the area. To this end, the participating teachers will carry out dissemination and cascade activities among their peers and with the teachers of the municipal schools. Furthermore, they will publish the results in the educational nets our school is involved in (European Salesian Schools and Catholic Schools in Madrid). We also hope to help consolidate the innovation processes at the center and the European dimension of education that we have been working on during the last five years in our school. Finally, we hope that these training actions will lead to future European projects (exchanges, etwinning, knowledge alliances,\u2026) with our partners and the new contacts we will make in the courses we will be participating  in.", "http://www.saviosalesiancollege.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-037669_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "L30"}
