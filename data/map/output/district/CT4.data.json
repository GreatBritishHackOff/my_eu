Our proprietary middleware allows us to produce custom components directly from digital 3D models, eliminating the need for manual programming and maximizing production speed.\nThrough our groundbreaking technology we currently enable thousands of consumers to build their house interior exactly as they imagine it from custom wardrobes and cabinets to bed-frames and doors, all with a few clicks on our 3D design tool. We have successfully marketed this technology and have made it available through our website.\nHouseBuildR is bold step forward. It comprises a sophisticated large-scale CNC machine, capable of producing plywood blocks in custom geometries of sufficient size to be used in house building. It is thus ideal for self-builders, i.e. people who prefer to build their houses from scratch, a market segment that accounts for almost 640,000 new houses in the EU and the US. \nOur vision is clear. We aim to completely redefine Structural Insulated Panel (SIP) based house construction by adapting our technology to achieve end-to-end house building automation. This new paradigm will not only enable end-customers to design and self-build their homes themselves but also drive the construction costs down by at least 20%.\nOur solution enables a transition to energy efficient houses with greatly reduced carbon footprint. Houses built with HouseBuildR will feature 2.5 times more effective insulation due to inherent qualities of plywood SIP. This will result in an estimated CO2 reduction of 4391 tonnes per year.\nThrough this action, we aim to fund a feasibility study for our product, which is already at TRL6, and establish the estimated potential of our business growing by \u20ac31m gross revenues and \u20ac13.7m operating profits over the 5 years following HouseBuildR\u2019s official market launch, generating a total of approximately 195 direct and 1100 indirect jobs.", 43972.0, 62817.0, "HouseBuildR", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_213698_924156831"], ["8AU", "An innovative fruit ripeness checker, to offer non-destructive testing in order to ensure resource efficient fruit processing - Ripesense", "North Court Fruit Farm", "Fresh\u2019 fruits for the consumer market can only be sold as such if they are shown to be a certain standard of \u2018ripeness\u2019, as judged by the sugar content and firmness. There is great commercial pressure on producers to provide produce which is of the appropriate standard. Apples which do not meet this standard can be sold to the wholesale market or juiced with losses to market value of 50% and 95% respectively, but apples & citrus fruits which are destructively tested are sold as animal feed, composted or sent to landfill. \nAs a result, fruits are tested many times during the production cycle, both in harvesting and distribution. Unfortunately, the most widely used tests for both are destructive tests. This leads to the destruction of between 6 \u2013 8% of harvested apples and approximately 5% of citrus fruits for testing purposes. Worldwide, this would amount to 4.6 \u2013 6.1 million tonnes of apples and 6.6 million tonnes of citrus fruit annually. At average European prices, this represents a combined economic loss of \u20ac6.3 \u2013 7.2 billion every year. \nRipesense is an innovative solution to this problem. The objective of our project is to develop and produce an automated system capable of non-destructively testing both the firmness and sugar content of fruits, initially apples and citrus fruits.\nThe main benefits of these performance objectives are to provide a system that can:\n\u2022 Replace destructive test methods with non-destructive \u2018Ripesense\u2019, reducing waste fruit going to landfill by 50%\n\u2022 Reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced by waste fruit sent to landfill \n\u2022 Reduce customer complaints 30% by using Ripesense frequently to minimise risk of overripe fruit reaching consumer\n\u2022 Reduce time & labour testing fruits for ripeness, enabling a 50% reduction in QC staff for more advantageous deployment \n\u2022 Allow fruits to be optimally distributed to retailers with different quality criteria, further increasing yield efficiency by ~10% apples", 35846.0, 51209.0, "Ripesense", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_196247_937896493"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7TA", "EUROPE COMICS", "CINEBOOK LIMITED", 1670098.0, "The Project EUROPE COMICS consists in the cooperation of 13 publishing players working together to create, diffuse and promote worldwide a digital, English-language European comics catalogue aiming to give European works and authors international visibility and widen the comics audience in Europe and abroad. This is to be achieved through the reinforcement of the cultural players in terms of know-how, international experience and networking, the development of comics-specific digital technologies and the testing of a new, intelligent business model with the overall result of strengthening the entire sector. A stronger sector will enhance European creativity and the emergence of new authors and publishers thus creating a larger and more inclusive literary offer, for a greater and more varied comics readership. The project partnership includes European publishers of different sizes, two agents and an audiovisual company who will put together their original works and professional expertise inside an innovative digital ecosystem. More specifically, the publishers will promote the catalogue and its authors locally and nationally at fairs and events, and invest in comics software development. The agents, on their side, will handle the strategic marketing of the catalogue, will coordinate the international author tours and digital distribution of the works in major online retailers and libraries. The audiovisual partner will bring the project a step further by investing in the development of animated series, further strengthening the presence of the European comics characters amidst a wider international audience.  Among the tangible and intangible outcomes of the project will be the creation of a European comics directory with statistical information on markets and trends, a European pioneering in the field of creative digital technologies and innovative, durable publishing business models, and the enhancement and internationalisation of European literary heritage.", "http://www.cinebook.co.uk", null, "creative_559716-CREA-1-2015-1-FR-CULT-COOP2_11"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CT4"}
