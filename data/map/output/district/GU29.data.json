In 56% of these operations, the components, in particular the cup, are not aligned correctly; this misalignment alters the biomechanics of the system, such that excessive wear of the cup occurs. The subsequent reduction in implant lifespan will affect ~450,000 European citizens, an average of 30,000 per year. In financial terms, the annual cost to European healthcare institutes is in the region of \u20ac426m euros, in addition to the increased likelihood of re-revision and associated aftercare costs.\nThere are two types of navigation system currently on the market: (1) Image based which uses CT data to generate 3D preoperative images, and (2) Image-free systems which rely on kinematic data or point-clouds acquired intra-operatively to generate a 3D reconstruction that can be explored during the operation on a computer screen. Both systems have demonstrated improved accuracy over manual surgery. However, current systems entail a large initial cost (~\u20ac250K) with high maintenance costs; in addition, most systems take an extra 15 minutes to setup, using valuable theatre time.\nThe D2Eye project will develop a simple to use, low cost, fully mobile guidance system with reduced set up time. The guidance system will allow the surgeon to position the cup accurately allowing for optimum range of movement and as a result will prevent premature failure of the implant normally associated with misalignment. This will be done using a series of electronic orientation units built in to the surgical instruments which will give their position in free space. The information from the units will be projected in front of the surgeon\u2019s eye in real time, allowing them to identify the correct cup implantation position; such a system will enable implant lifetimes to be extended beyond the current average 15 year lifespan, significantly reducing the burden on the healthcare system.", 167363.0, 1081222.0, "D2EYE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.huntdevelopments.co.uk", null, "fp7_185473_996071661"], ["9HX", "Enhanced Durability Resurfacing Endoprosthesis", "Hunt Developments (Uk) Ltd", "Each year in Europe there are:- \u2022 800000 hip operations costing approximately \u20ac1,942 per/implant, worth over \u20ac1.5 billion \u2022 Hip implant operations are rising by approximately 15%. \u2022 Currently 10% of all the prosthesis implanted are in patients under 55 years of age of which 33% of these will fail within 16 years with a further 20% of implant fitted to over 55\u2019s failing with in 20 years requiring revisional surgery costing \u20ac2.3 billion per annum. Treatment of younger patients with severe hip disease using a conventional THR presents a challenge with the rate of success being very low, (most failing within 16 years). To over come this Finsbury help develop the MoM BHR resurfacing hip with a survival rate of 93% over a conventional THR. However, studies have reported high concentrations of Co &amp; Cr in the serum and/or urine of patients with MoM resurfacing implants. Studies have shown that increased levels of Co &amp; Cr cause caners such as leukaemia and are linked with myocardiopathy. During the course of this project we intend to overcome these problems by developing a ceramic one ceramic or ceramic on polymer resurfacing hip. Like that of the MOM prosthesis will only cover the femoral head thus retaining all of the desirable properties associated with retaining an intact femur.", 206482.0, 1290540.0, "ENDURE", "Safer and more durable hip implants", "Increasing the durability of hip prosthetics is sometimes accompanied by the release of hazardous substances into the body. EU-funded scientists developed novel ceramic-on-polymer prosthetics for a superior implant.", "An unsatisfactory proportion of prosthetics implanted during conventional total hip replacement (THR) fails within the first 16 to 20 years. An orthopedic consultant may recommend a procedure called hip resurfacing, rather than a (THR) for more active patients whose bones are of good quality, allowing greater preservation of natural bone in and around the joint and providing greater durability. This involves replacing the damaged or diseased surface of the ball and socket joint in the hip with highly polished metallic capping, known as metal on metal (MoM) hip resurfacing.  However, reports of high blood and serum levels of cobalt and chromium in patients with MoM devices have raised important concerns about their long-term effects.\n\nEU-funded scientists set out to develop an improved hip prosthesis using high-performance ceramics with high compressive strength, wear resistance and chemical inertness. The project 'Enhanced durability resurfacing endoprosthesis' http://www.endure-fp7.com/ ((ENDURE)) set the ambitious goal of a prosthetic lifetime in excess of thirty years.\n\nIn order to arrive at the ceramic-on-polymer resurfacing hip prosthesis, researchers focused on alumina matrix composite bioceramics and carbon fibre-reinforced poly\u2013ether\u2013ether\u2013ketone. They developed new cost-effective polymer-processing methods and employed extensive theoretical and experimental testing to arrive at the final designs. The system and its implantation were successfully tested and demonstrated by specialised surgeons working on cadavers.\n\nPreliminary publication of results on the project website has led to a flurry of inquiries and expressed interest, providing the impetus for expediting the clinical trials process. Commercialisation will be of great importance to the EU economy and the competitive position of its small and medium-sized enterprises working in the field. Reduction in revisional surgeries will also enable tremendous savings for the health system and, of course, significantly enhanced quality of life for the many hip replacement patients of every age.", "http://www.endure-fp7.com", "http://www.huntdevelopments.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014-01/58286.jpg", "fp7_92265_996071661"]]}}, "outwardCode": "GU29"}
