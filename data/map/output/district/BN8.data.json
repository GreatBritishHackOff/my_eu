We are passionate about inspiring and empowering people to participate more actively in creating healthy and resilient local communities. We aim for our work to help people live healthy and fulfilling lives, as well as increasing people\u2019s motivation to take care of the natural environment. \r\n\r\nMany of our funded educational activities are specifically tailored for mental health users and people with physical learning difficulties, often at the most isolated and vulnerable edge of the spectrum. We aim to equip adults with the necessary skills and key safety aspects to make independent choices, and to increase levels of confidence across all areas of life. In training alongside others, our learners increase their networks of support, reduced isolation through shared experiences and increase learning. Our work supports increased social inclusion of often disadvantaged and marginalised people.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen our work in ways that bring about the kinds of wider social benefits we aim for, we have identified a range of needs that relate to increasing the quality of our work and staff competences, as well as enabling us to extend and improve our curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe key areas of need are:\r\n1) Strengthening staff competence to work with diverse learners in a multicultural context. \r\n2) Strengthening staff competence to apply eco-psychological and eco-therapeutic approaches with learners from disadvantaged communities and groups. \r\n3) Increasing organisational capacity to run longer wilderness immersion courses. \r\n4) Broadening our curriculum to go beyond wellbeing and inclusion towards pro-environmental behaviour. \r\n\r\nIn terms of internationalisation, we recognise that strengthening our international networks and connections across EU countries can help us to meet these needs in important ways. Therefore, we want to build strong links enabling our staff access to training in Europe, especially as exemplified in the work of Col\u00b7lectiu Eco-Actiu and their Nature Based Practice and Learning Program.\r\n\r\nDuring 2018 we will send 19 members of staff, both junior and senior facilitators, on a series of structured training courses and teaching assignments.\r\n\r\nThese activities will enable us to further the professional development of our trainers and move the organisation along a pathway towards key strategic development goals.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of the project are to meet the key needs listed 1 to 4 above. In addition we aim for these activities to enable staff to: experience and understand a plurality of pedagogical approaches, which will enhance their capacity to deliver innovative and high quality adult education in the field of nature connection; feel more confident and inspired in their work as educators; make valuable steps in their own professional development, so as to increase their future employability and economic security; gain significant experience of pan-European cooperation in the sharing of best practices and the development of innovative pedagogical approaches.\r\n\r\nWe envisage the Nature Connection for Social Inclusion and Pro-Environmental Action project to enable us to make some significant advances in terms of the quality and provision of nature-based education with diverse and disadvantaged learners. There will be an increase in our capacity to develop innovative and high quality work. Best practice in the design and delivery of nature-based education will be shared between European partners. Our trainers will work more effectively with multicultural learners, and in providing more transformative and immersive educational opportunities. Our ability to foster learner centred educational approaches will be significantly enhanced. We will be able to develop innovative curricula that promote pro-environmental behaviour. \r\n\r\nThe longer-term benefits include: Stronger links between nature-based educators across Europe; increased capacity within the sector in the UK; More innovative approaches to nature-based education which support disadvantaged groups; Nature-based educators being better equipped to work in a multicultural setting, thus supporting a more tolerant and pluralistic society; Learners being inspired and motivated in ways that support increasing civil society responses to the ecological crisis now facing us.", "http://www.circleofliferediscovery.com", "Circle of Life Rediscovery CIC", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA104-035987_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BN8"}
