To do so, it is fundamental that players and coaches can be exposed to different approaches, to enrich their understanding of the game and develop skills and mental assets different to those currently in place at the Ayr RFC.\r\n\r\nCoaching staff need to enhance and enrich their knowledge by learning how to master different playing styles other than the Scottish one. Scottish rugby tradition praises itself for having a well structured and organised playing style, but lack of the ability to read and play situations of open field attack. On the contrary the proposed hosting partner Castres Olympique teaches and plays the famous \u201cFrench Flair\u201d, a playing style based on a combination of rugged physicality and improvisation during the attacking phase. To keep the pace of its contenders and being able to provide better opportunities to its Academy players and staffs to become full time professionals the clubs has decided to look at international cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of the mobility will help Ayr RFC to further develop its offer of Rugby, attracting more individuals and nurturing and retaining the most talented ones. By dramatically enhancing the formative offer of its Academy, Ayr RFC will indeed produce young players who will be able to compete in the rugby industry, as players, coaches, or in other dual career roles. This will also address priority areas covered by the Erasmus+ programme, such as reducing unemployment levels, enhancing skills and competences of apprentices in Sports, creating and developing opportunities for European cooperation and promoting multilingualism. Finally the project will provide travelling apprentices and staff with a paramount opportunity to develop skills including but not limited to multicultural communication, diplomacy, team building, self awareness, networking, tolerance, self confidence, adaptability and self assessment.\r\n\r\nAyr RFC will send a group of 40 players and 12 staff to train at Castres Olympique training centre and under the direction of local coaches for 14 days. This period will represent a full immersion on the French Flair philosophy, a different approach to the Scottish Rugby training. Apprentices are enrolled at local colleges and attend training at the Academy two evenings per week, with an additional weekly fixture to be played at the week end. They are between 15 and 18 years old and forming the U18 and U16 squads. Apprentices and coaches are representative of the local social fabric, including SIMD areas.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this mobility all participants will acquire a deep knowledge of the French Flair philosophy, being able to reproduce sessions (coaching staff) and to perform it on a rugby pitch (young players). All the new skills, methodologies, techniques and abilities connected with the French Flair will contribute to enhance the professional profile of all participants, and provide them higher chances to secure and retain a job in professional rugby industry in the future. \r\n\r\nThe overseas experience will have a great and tangible impact on the skills possessed by participants, which will be enhance as a result of the mobility. Participants\u2019 adaptability, diplomacy, self confidence, self assessment and self awareness, intercultural communication, team building and networking will all be enhanced. Young apprentices will be able to challenge for a position at Ayr RFC 1st XV, and to progress towards professionalism in the UK or abroad, with particular regards to the English Aviva Premiership, the French Top 14 and the Welsh/Scottish/Italian Pro 12.
