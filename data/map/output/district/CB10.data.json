According to this scope, breakthrough technologies will be researched and developed according to 4 HEECS main project objectives: 1) New and improved semiconductor technologies mainly focused on innovative high frequency power solid state devices. 2) Improved thermal management systems to efficiently cool the high frequency power transistor package, and make use of the dissipated heat energy in an efficient way. 3) Intelligent electromagnetic (EM) field adjustment and high frequency controls, in order to better distribute the field intensity within differing food types, thereby heating the food appropriately and decreasing losses. 4) Optimized MWO technology configuration and system architecture delivering optimum feeding and efficiency of the MWO through enhanced signal conditioning. Matching the overall ENIAC objectives, all the electronic parts of the solid state cooking device, including small signal board (frequency synthesizer, High speed RF switching, micro controller), Switched mode power supply unit, high frequency power amplification stages, RF sensing and coupling, will be built with miniaturised circuits.

Detailed assessment of RNA sequencing procedures on the exome revealed standardisation in sample quantification, target enrichment and sequencing library preparation across participating labs. However, filtering procedures in subsequent analysis pipelines, alignment of sequencing readouts and variant naming were subject to substantial differences.\n\nUsing the highly standardised procedures, 500 RNA samples were distributed and analysed.
