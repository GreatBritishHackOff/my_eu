Recently some achievements have been made (e.g. SEM and SIM have merged into SIEM, and LACS and PACS have merged into IM), Security Operations Center (SOC) technology has improved significantly, but much is yet to be done. SAWSOC holistic approach and enhanced awareness technology will allow dependable (i.e. accurate, timely, and trustworthy) detection and diagnosis of attacks. This will ultimately result in the achievement of two goals of paramount importance, and precisely: 1) Guaranteeing the protection of citizens and assets, and 2) Improving the perception of security by citizens. Goal 1 is in line with the objectives of the Security Work Programme in general, and goal 2 perfectly matches the expected impact as listed in the Work Programme for Topic SEC-2012.2.5-1. SAWSOC\u2019s design will be driven by three real use cases, with highly diverse requirements. Such use cases collectively form an experimental test-bed perfectly suited for driving the design as well as for validating the development of a platform such as SAWSOC that will support true convergence of physical and logical security technologies, and overcome the fragmentation of security approaches. The first use case deals with the protection of a Critical Infrastructure for Air Traffic Management. The second deals with the protection of a Critical Infrastructure for Energy Production and Distribution. The third deals with the protection of a public place, specifically a stadium, during an event. The project will take stock of associated initiatives, which have a direct or indirect link with the topic (e.g.: topic SEC-2011.2.5-1 Cyber attacks against critical infrastructures, ESRAB and ESRIF), and will benefit of an enhanced SME participation in the Consortium, with three hi-tech SMEs from three different countries, playing relevant as well as complementary roles.", 282656.0, 4174542.0, "SAWSOC", null, null, null, "http://www.sawsoc.eu/", "http://www.intercede.com", null, "fp7_110931_953735526"], ["5BH", "Development of extraction process for removal of pigments and additives for recycling of polymers", "Pg Instruments Limited", "Production of PE in Western Europe alone is 13.5 million tonnes p.a.

The annual production world wide of 60 mill. tons PE indicates a world wide market of \u20ac3,3 Bn. As of today, there is no technical solution available that has the ability to remove pigments and other selected additives from the recycled material. The prospect of a technology enabling removal of pigments and selected additives from scrap opens up a range of possibilities in terms of quality of, and applications for recycled material. In addition, it would have a large impact on the need for virgin material and thus, raw material consumption. The overall technological aim of the project is the development of a controlled supercritical fluid extraction unit that quickly and efficiently removes pigments and selected additives from waste polyethylene. Among the drivers are European Commission directives such as 2004/12/EC Packaging and packaging waste, in addition to the strategy on prevention and recycling of waste. Today, China is a large player on the scrap market, buying enormous volumes. China has reduced imports of virgin resin by importing recycled and scrap polymer, increasing the amount of domestic recycling. China is the world\u2019s largest polyethylene customer, importing 5.65tonnes in 2005, which was well below expectations due to the imports of recycled and scrap polymer.

In Europe there are more than 50,000 broiler breeders who are facing a major problem concerning control of air- and insect-borne pathogens in their broiler houses, which results in high infection rates of the broiler flocks. This is partly caused by insects \u2013 especially flies \u2013 entering the broiler house through the ventilation system. The Airpath project seeks to solve this problem by developing a new type of barrier based on electrostatic precipitation. This is a known technology used in larger applications where cost is not a major concern such as chimneys on power plants. Hence, the technology must be further developed, scaled and adapted to the specific needs of the European broiler industry. Background of the project The project seeks to solve one of the major challenges that the poultry sector is facing concerning airborne pathogens. An example is Campylobacter which is a major problem in broiler houses (and in the consumer product). At certain times of the year (the warmer months) the breeders experience a rise of infection to more than 60-80% of the flocks. A previous study by DTU Veterinary Institute in Denmark has demonstrated that a major source of the infections is flies entering the houses through the ventilation system. DTU has demonstrated that by effectively keeping the flies out of the broiler houses, the number of infected populations will be drastically reduced. Using simple fly screens it was possible to reduce the infection rate to 15% of the flocs in the problematic period, whereas control populations not using screens showed more 50% infection rate.", 418566.0, 3393175.0, "AIRPATH", null, null, null, null, "http://www.eseparator.com", null, "fp7_94939_996465384"], ["6LZ", "CLEANSITE: Novel Electrochemical Oxidation for Landfill Leachate Treatment", "Euroteknik Ltd", "The CLEANSITE project will develop a novel system and technology for on-site treatment of collected landfill waste water \u2013 or leachate \u2013 though a novel and intelligent treatment method, which combines highly innovative electrochemical treatment or advanced oxidation methods with smart sensor\u2019s and enabling microelectronic technology for optimised process control and design.
