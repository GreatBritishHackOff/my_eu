Regarding the use of HSLA steels, it has been well documented that today\u2019s merchant ships are prone to crack initiation and propagation in stress concentration areas mostly due to fatigue loads.\nIn this respect it is envisaged to replace Grade A or AH steels by HSLA steels with high toughness properties in specific areas of the ship structure, thereby reducing the risk of cracks developing in stress concentration areas. Concerning the use of composite materials, it is envisaged that they could replace parts of the steel structure, such as superstructures, piping and other non-critical parts.

Moreover, in the supply of ship building components and services, the EU is a world leader. As a result, the maritime industry, which includes ship building and ship operation, are vital to Europe\u2019s economy.\n\nIn this industry sector, structural failure is a major cause of the loss of ships, vessels and tankers resulting in loss of life and pollution of the world\u2019s oceans, seas and coastal waters of Europe. Indeed, it has been reported in 2006, that each year over 400 ocean going ships sink, many as a result of weakened structures due to corrosion and inadequate/poor welding quality.\n\nMost of the inspection techniques used to date proved to be disruptive to the manufacturing process and far from being cost effective. Additionally, as the current generation of ships are being built from thinner section steels (10mm or less) to lower the cost of build and ship operation, typical assessment methods are not as effective as for thicker sections. Therefore, there is a real need for more reliable, faster, cost effective and safer inspection techniques.\n\nThe X-Scan project aims to respond to this need by developing novel automated NDT techniques (ultrasonic and electromagnetic) for ship structures.
