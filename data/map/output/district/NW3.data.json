The principal aim of this project is to exploit this information by establishing a platform where gp41-derived vaccine candidates will be designed to elicit neutralising Abs. Several families of immunogens which mimic gp41 in its fusion intermediate conformations are already available and others will be designed using modelisation approaches. Candidates will be submitted to a thorough biophysical characterisation followed by a preclinical development in order to identify the most promising for clinical evaluation. A crucial selection parameter is the capacity of antigens to elicit neutralising Abs using internationally standardized assays. Since sexual transmission accounts for more than 90% of HIV infection, the capacity of Abs to inhibit infection at the mucosal level will also be determined. This cross-disciplinary project gathers top European scientists with expertise in protein engineering and characterisation, adjuvantation, formulation for systemic and mucosal delivery, evaluation of functional antibody response, efficacy testing in animal models, medium to large scale vaccine production as well as conduct of clinical trials in both developed and third-world countries. In contrast to previous more empirical attempts, this project is based on the rational exploitation of the knowledge on the mechanism of HIV entry and is thus a promising approach to generate a protective vaccine. It will be the first European project targeting intermediate conformations of gp41 and it could complement/synergize other international strategies focusing on the membrane proximal region of gp41 or gp140 trimer to induce neutralising Abs or aiming at reducing the viral load by eliciting a cellular immunity against HIV.", 197006.0, 13454030.0, "EURONEUT-41", "Towards a preventive HIV vaccine", "A European consortium is tackling HIV infection by generating neutralising antibodies.

Among 17 candidates, the most promising immunogen has been selected and developed further for clinical use. The ultimate goal is to test this vaccine in phase I clinical trials using mucosal and parenteral routes of immunisation.\n\nThe vaccine generated by Euroneut-41 constitutes a novel effort to prevent HIV infection by blocking viral cell entry.

Kidney replacement therapy is necessary when kidney function is below 10% of the normal value. Much effort is put into developing strategies to prevent chronic kidney disease progression. Regenerative medicine still is in the experimental phase and kidney transplantation is only available for a small number of patients. Indeed, the everyday reality is the growing number of dialysis patients. Haemodialysis treatment is the current standard of care for the vast majority of patients with end stage kidney disease. It is a substantial burden to the patient and for society. Haemodialysis treatment is associated with high risks for fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease, for infections, hospitalisation and low quality of life. Improvement in the currently available standard is urgently needed. \n\nOver the past decade an alternative for haemodialysis became available, i.e. haemodiafiltration. Both are accepted by regulatory authorities. Haemodiafiltration removes waste products that are accumulated due to kidney failure, more effecticvely than standard hemodialysis. Present evidence supports the idea of superiority of haemodialfiltration compared to standard haemodialysis. However, definite proof is lacking and as a consequence haemodiafiltration is not yet widely applied. \n\nThis consortium aims to determine the best possible dialysis treatment by comparing the conventional guideline based haemodialysis treatment versus high-dose haemodiafiltration by carrying out a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial addressing clinical endpoints, quality of life and a cost-utility analysis.

In the context of lowering levels of participation in democratic life, apathy towards the complexity of EU institutions and transnational problems, disillusionment regarding politics and policies, at national, European and international levels, 17 students from 4 European countries (UK, Belgium, Italy and Hungary) will gather in Cambridge to answer in depth questions that each generation has to face in order to stay united: What does it mean to be Europeans? Is sovereignty still the answer in a globalized world? What are our common roots ... if any? How do we react towards the rising tide of immigration? How can different religions coexist peacefully in our modern European society? How should we relate to Russia? What is the future of our freedoms? How do European institutions really work?\r\n\r\nWith these questions in mind, ACE has 2 main objectives:\r\n1. Strengthen European values and participation in European democratic life for young people. Through informal talks, guided and exploratory discussions with experts and facilitators, participants can develop informed opinions on key European issues (namely, the common European values, West-East European integration, the future of the EU political project, inter cultural and inter-religious dialogue, EU rights and responsibilities, EU - Russia relations, future demographic challenges in Europe). By exposing the fundamental issues at stake for each theme, the stereotypes or the misconceptions, these highly participatory sessions are meant to encourage young people's analysis skills, responsible citizenship and active participation in Europe's public square.\r\n\r\n2. Help students to realize that they should start to think their future in an European context and to think that the traditional path school-one job-retirement is no longer the norm. Thus, they have to develop a good set of soft skills in order to enhance their employability and ease the shift from school to labour market. This objective will be reached through workshops, role plays and simulations which  are meant to improve the following soft skills: team working, communication, negotiation, time management, cultural adaptability, analysis skills, decision making, research and information management skills.\r\n\r\nParticipants will be open minded and pro-active University students (age range 19 to 24 years old): during the selection process students will not be assessed on the level of knowledge about Europe, the EU or soft skills training, but on their curiosity and interest in wanting to know more about it. The exchange is meant to bring together inquisitive young people that after an intensive exchange in Cambridge, each and every one of them can share during a follow up event in their communities part of their experience or what inspired them the most. By showing what the European project is about, the project aims to inspire enthusiasm and a network of young Europeans that promote the idea of a united Europe locally and nationally.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the exchange students will have an increased knowledge regarding the European dimension of their life, as young people, learners, citizens, and workers. In particular, participants will have had the opportunity to develop informed opinions on :\r\n- common European values\r\n- EU citizenship rights and responsibilities\r\n- EU integration: Eastern-Western Europe, inter-religious dialogue (focus on Islam).\r\nThe project gives high importance to students\u2019 acquisition of soft skills or transversal competencies.
