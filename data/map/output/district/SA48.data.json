By combining the results of the G-TwYST project with those of the GRACE project (90-day and 1-year study with maize MON810) it will be possible for the first time to describe the potential medium term and long term toxic effects of the two above-mentioned events.\nPartners will strictly comply with international standards and norms concerning feeding trials and closely collaborate with EFSA. Feeding stuff used in the trials will be produced according to the principles of good agricultural practice. The project will analyse and report the results of the feeding trials and develop recommendations on the scientific justification and added value of long-term feeding trials for GMO risk assessment.\nThe project will ensure scientific excellence, independence and transparency of both the research process and the results. Transparency and accessibility of project plans and results is a key characteristic of the project and will be ensured by establishing a project website and by using an open access database set up by GRACE as information hubs. Results will be published as open access journal papers. Dedicated engagement, communication, and dissemination activities will target scientists, policy makers and a broad range of stakeholders.

They are an important component of European agriculture, notably in terms of biodiversity, cultural landscape, territorial cohesion, quality products and employment. However, abandonment, degradation, economic and social marginalisation are long-standing challenges for the associated farming systems which are still under considerable pressure. For national and local authorities, the European Union and the Common Agricultural Policy, and for stakeholders, the challenge is twofold: \n\u2022 To avoid further degradation and disappearance of HNV farming and increase their socio-economic viability: this could be done by collating, evaluating and disseminating innovations as tools for their development; \n\u2022 To maintain their \u201cnatural value\u201d, i.e the environmental services they provide to the society. \nFor these reasons, our consortium, an EIP Agri Focus Group and new partners, propose a network dedicated to supporting HNV farming, networking HNV areas covering a range of different farming systems across the EU, and to focussing on innovations improving simultaneously \u201csocio-economic viability\u201d and \u201cenvironmental efficiency\u201d. \nConceived as a \u201csupport service\u201d for knowledge and innovation exchanges, the HNV-Link network will give a decisive new impetus to this sector, and will provide tools to organisations, actors and networks supporting HNV farmlands. The marginality of HNV areas in conventional research and development means that HNV farming-related innovation is rarely discussed in academic exchanges.

We therefore developed a plan to be implemented in one  year. Our plan follows three basic directions: a)Learning of how to use  digital computer technology in everyday teaching and learning and through all the subjects taught at school, b) Learning of how to manage and coordinate  European programs, c) Opening up our school to Europe through collaborative European projects  with other schools abroad. We realised that even if our school  has  quite good technological facilities, our teachers seem a bit hesitant to use them everyday in class.  They also find that applying  for European programs is quite compex and demanding - a feeling that becomes more intense because of the lack of contacts with other colleagues and schools in Europe. We  find it necessary to address all these problems by choosing  a combination of seminars, job shadowing and follow up activities for our teachers to attend in order to achieve our goals.\r\nIn this framework, 5 teachers were chosen to be sent for the mobilities. All of them have a good command of English, they have good computer skills, they are interested in conducting projects in their classes and are very eager to improve their skills and knowledge on the sectors mentioned before. They are also very communicative people with intrinsic motive and a genuine care for the improvement of our school unit and the education it provides. Moreover, they are  an interesting combination of teachers and specialty teachers in order for us to achieve cooperation and integration in as many subject areas as possible. Last but not least, they all have excellent relationships with the other staff members something that will guarantee that the follow up activities will be a success. \r\nTaking all the above into consideration, 3 main activities were chosen: \r\na) Mobility of 1 teacher for job shadowing at Ysgol y Dderi in Wales. This school is an excellent organisation with huge experience in managing and coordinating European projects. It uses project based teaching and learning extensively. Moreover, it uses a big range of digital tools in its everyday classroom practice with great success. In our opinion,  this school is the best environment for us to observe in real conditions what we dream of achieving in our school environment and be given guidelines of how exactly to get there. \r\nb) Mobilities of 2 teachers and 1 physical education teacher for attending a seminar on how to use Web 2.0 digital tools in class and how to organise a digital classroom. With this seminar we aim at familiarising our teachers with information technology more and at acquiring the knowledge that is necessary to facilitate the rest of our needs. \r\n\u03b3) Mobility of our  English Language teacher for attending a seminar  on management and coordination of European projects in order for us to be able to succeed in applying for Erasmus+ collaborative projects and to expand our European contacts with colleagues and schools abroad.\r\nBefore the mobilities, our teachers will be prepared adequately in our own organisation and in cooperation with the courses provider in Spain and our partner school in Wales.\r\nAfter the mobilities and from the beginning of the new school year, follow up activities will be held within our organisation in order to transfer and propagate the knowledge acquired during the mobilities and with focus to all target groups (the rest of the school staff, students and parents). We will also proceed in starting new collaborative projects in order to practice all the things we've learned. \r\nWith the implementation of all the above we hope in the long run to become members of a school unit with up to date trained staff, which will be able to enjoy the benefits of European partnerships confidently and that will have the ability to bring changes and to promote innovations using all the latest technological advances in favour of our school community.", "http://www.ydderi.ceredigion.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-EL01-KA101-013292_1"], ["8AF", "Healthy lifestyles and Sport", "Ceredigion County Council Youth Service", 22667.0, "40 young people, aged 16-18 will participate in a 'Sport and Healthy Lifestyles' Youth Exchange in Llangrannog, West Wales this summer.  The project will be carried out from 21 - 28 August consisting of 6 activity days. \r\n\r\nThis project is a follow up of the previous youth exchange taking place in Italy last July around a similar topic. It was reviewed and evaluated that a successive project will be beneficial for young people to continue to experience positive life-altering experiences and improve their personal skills and knowledge of sport and healthy lifestyles. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the this  project is to forge greater links between the young people of all the participating countries and provide opportunities for them to develop themselves personally, socially, physically, emotionally and mentally through sport and cultural activities. They will have an increase in knowledge and attitude towards adopting a healthy lifestyle, encompassing physical activity and sport, and how to actively participate, and encourage others to participate also, generating a more active community. It is hoped they will also increase an awareness towards different cultures and how people have different interests, values and provision of sport and physical activities; an improvement of skills and recognition of new skills by participating in new sporting activities and cultural activities; an increase in knowledge and awareness of how to engage in sport and physical activity, and how these can be made inclusive to all; opportunities to develop self-fulfilment and how to be better active citizens in their communities, including local national and International contexts. In turn, this will enhance social inclusion and more actively engaged societies.\r\nThe project includes several workshops, presentations, thematic games, physical exercises,  discussions, focus groups and intercultural activities together with evaluation sessions useful to reflect on own personal and group learning in order to help participants to build their own Youthpass accreditation. \r\n\r\nAfter the exchange the groups, as testimonials, will organize  meetings with their local communities (schools and local institutions) to show and display the results of the exchange and the main goals achieved, present the methodology, tools developed, opportunity in E+ for  Public Body (EVS and strategic partnerships) and Youth (mobility). They will discuss future steps, define solutions for an efficient local policy devoted to youth wellbeing and using this project as an initial stepping stone to greater projects.

Therefore we need to think \"Out of the Box\", tackling the concepts of personal identity and issues such as stereotypes and prejudices, being aware of a complex dynamic between two different cultures that can not be miscalculated in a simple problem.\r\n Integration is a manner of equilibrium between the recognition of identities,that is defined trough dialogue and acceptance of diversity that brings consequently to a pleasant cohabitation. \r\n\r\nThe exchange will gather 40 participants, balanced in the number of females and males, between 14 and 17 years old and 10 leaders from five different countries: Spain, Malta, Wales, Poland and Italy. Countries that have different policy in terms of integration and immigration also because of their geographical location in Europe and in these modern migration flows. \r\nIn the majority of the cases immigrants consider Italy, Malta and Spain as their first stop in Europe and their final destination are usually nations such as United Kingdom; in the other side Poland is considered as country of migrants. \r\n\r\nTherefore participants will have different thoughts about the issue of immigration as well as different opinions when speaking about integration.\r\n \r\nThe exchange's activities are divided into several parts facing different topics like: identity, different cultures, stereotypes and prejudices, the reason of migration, constructive dialoge. \r\nSingular parts that will be linked in the final days of the projects because they are necessary in order to analyse the concept of cultural integration The exchange will face all those topics using different methodology and tools like: workshops, brainstorming, role games, cooperation games  and non formal education activities, methods and tools that are considered by the leader appropriate in order to reach the aims of the projects. \r\n\r\nDuring the phase of debriefing and evaluation of the project's activities, the impact we expect to have is to make the participants more aware on the issue of immigration and more specifically in the issue of integration and social inclusion. \r\nWe also expect that the youngsters will develop a critical thinking regarding multiculturalism and integration less conditioned by thirds and we aim at the fact that they will be more interested to learn from those people that are still being considered different because of their culture, language and color of the skin. \r\nMoreover the participants will improve their skills of working in team as well as they'll recognize the crucial importance of the English language and generally speaking of foreign languages. \r\nAs conclusion we focus to make the participants improve both their relation and confrontational skills and assume an active role as citizen in their local community and school in order to promote multicultural dialogue within the organization they belong to at a local an regional level. \r\n\r\nLong term benefits for participants will be their permanent change of behavior in accepting immigrants in their daily life, understanding and sharing their habits and needs an they will become active citizens in promoting intercultural dialogue. \r\nThe organizations themselves will apply to create education paths about intercultural issues and will set up projects in a large scale supporting other organizations to exploit the project results building new Erasmus+ projects.", "http://www.ceredigion.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT03-KA105-013231_3"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["7ED", "Growing Workforces Through Learning and Development (GWLAD)", "University of Wales Trinity Saint David", "Providing business with practical, flexible and achievable on-going staff development through specific courses at intermediate and higher skills levels to meet the needs of employers.", "ESF", 2037909.0, 3136745.0, "esf_wales_80911"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8LJ", "THE EUROPEAN FORUM ON NATURE CONSERVATION AND PASTORALISM*EFNCP", 1485.0, "Other management expenditure (05.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_16790", 2016], ["8LJ", "THE EUROPEAN FORUM ON NATURE CONSERVATION AND PASTORALISM*EFNCP", 490.0, "Operational technical assistance (05.04.60.02)", "fts_2016_28944", 2016], ["8LJ", "THE EUROPEAN FORUM ON NATURE CONSERVATION AND PASTORALISM*EFNCP", 3423.0, "Other management expenditure (05.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_18582", 2017], ["8LJ", "THE EUROPEAN FORUM ON NATURE CONSERVATION AND PASTORALISM*EFNCP", 224.0, "Operational technical assistance (05.04.60.02)", "fts_2017_38641", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "SA48"}
