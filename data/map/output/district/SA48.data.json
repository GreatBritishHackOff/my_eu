In the case of maize NK603 two 90-day and a combined 2-year chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study will be performed.  By combining the results of the G-TwYST project with those of the GRACE project (90-day and 1-year study with maize MON810) it will be possible for the first time to describe the potential medium term and long term toxic effects of the two above-mentioned events.\nPartners will strictly comply with international standards and norms concerning feeding trials and closely collaborate with EFSA. Feeding stuff used in the trials will be produced according to the principles of good agricultural practice. The project will analyse and report the results of the feeding trials and develop recommendations on the scientific justification and added value of long-term feeding trials for GMO risk assessment.\nThe project will ensure scientific excellence, independence and transparency of both the research process and the results. Transparency and accessibility of project plans and results is a key characteristic of the project and will be ensured by establishing a project website and by using an open access database set up by GRACE as information hubs. Results will be published as open access journal papers. Dedicated engagement, communication, and dissemination activities will target scientists, policy makers and a broad range of stakeholders. Participatory steps will be included in the planning as well as in the interpretation/conclusion phase. Moreover, the views of risk assessment and regulatory bodies as well as wider societal issues will also be taken into consideration.\nThe results of the project will enable risk managers drawing conclusions with regard to framework of the currently applicable GM food/feed risk assessment requirements and procedures in the EU.", 198153.0, 3051151.0, "G-TWYST", null, null, null, null, "http://www.rogeralison.com", null, "fp7_191522_950002384"], ["8LJ", "High Nature Value Farming: Learning, Innovation and Knowledge.", "The European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism", "High nature value (HNV) farmland designates \u201cthose areas in Europe where agriculture is a major land use and where that agriculture supports, or is associated with, either a high species and habitat diversity or the presence of species of European conservation concern, or both\u201d. They are an important component of European agriculture, notably in terms of biodiversity, cultural landscape, territorial cohesion, quality products and employment. However, abandonment, degradation, economic and social marginalisation are long-standing challenges for the associated farming systems which are still under considerable pressure. For national and local authorities, the European Union and the Common Agricultural Policy, and for stakeholders, the challenge is twofold: \n\u2022 To avoid further degradation and disappearance of HNV farming and increase their socio-economic viability: this could be done by collating, evaluating and disseminating innovations as tools for their development; \n\u2022 To maintain their \u201cnatural value\u201d, i.e the environmental services they provide to the society. \nFor these reasons, our consortium, an EIP Agri Focus Group and new partners, propose a network dedicated to supporting HNV farming, networking HNV areas covering a range of different farming systems across the EU, and to focussing on innovations improving simultaneously \u201csocio-economic viability\u201d and \u201cenvironmental efficiency\u201d. \nConceived as a \u201csupport service\u201d for knowledge and innovation exchanges, the HNV-Link network will give a decisive new impetus to this sector, and will provide tools to organisations, actors and networks supporting HNV farmlands. The marginality of HNV areas in conventional research and development means that HNV farming-related innovation is rarely discussed in academic exchanges. Our thematic network, both grassroots-based and transnational, can really make a difference, by connecting farmers and innovation actors in line with the vision of the EIP-Agri \u201coperational groups'.", 324398.0, 1923316.0, "HNV-Link", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_200197_951762546"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["7ED", "Growing Workforces Through Learning and Development (GWLAD)", "University of Wales Trinity Saint David", "Providing business with practical, flexible and achievable on-going staff development through specific courses at intermediate and higher skills levels to meet the needs of employers.", "ESF", 2037909.0, 3136745.0, "esf_wales_80911"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8LJ", "THE EUROPEAN FORUM ON NATURE CONSERVATION AND PASTORALISM*EFNCP", 1485.0, "Other management expenditure (05.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_16790", 2016], ["8LJ", "THE EUROPEAN FORUM ON NATURE CONSERVATION AND PASTORALISM*EFNCP", 490.0, "Operational technical assistance (05.04.60.02)", "fts_2016_28944", 2016], ["8LJ", "THE EUROPEAN FORUM ON NATURE CONSERVATION AND PASTORALISM*EFNCP", 3423.0, "Other management expenditure (05.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_18582", 2017], ["8LJ", "THE EUROPEAN FORUM ON NATURE CONSERVATION AND PASTORALISM*EFNCP", 224.0, "Operational technical assistance (05.04.60.02)", "fts_2017_38641", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "SA48"}
