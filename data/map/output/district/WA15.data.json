Such a shift would of course be highly detrimental to the achievement of the general objectives of a sustainable development of the European transport system. The project would also find the best balance between environmental and economical requirements, in order to avoid an always possible shift from rail transport to a less sustainable mode like road, even on electrified main routes would also encourage the engine industry to give rail applications serious consideration in their product development plans and provide the European Commission with proposals for a flexible move to the IIIB objective.\nThe four years project is therefore build on the basis of several application sub-projects, representative of the different engine applications (rail cars, Diesel Multiple Units, shunting locomotives, main line light and heavy-haul locomotives) that will enable the industry to evaluate the different solutions to be applied to rail systems in real operating conditions.\nThe optimum trade-off between the reduction of pollutant emissions by rail vehicles and the fuel energy consumption and CO2 emissions, as well as the overall impact of the applied technologies on the environment through a life cycle assessment approach, will be identified by this experimental part of the project. But the rail manufacturing industry also wishes to foster the development of rail specific applications of innovative solutions so as to even further develop the competitive advantages of rail transport in terms of sustainable development.", 279095.0, 11011186.0, "CLEANER-D", "Greener and cleaner diesel vehicles", "An EU-funded project sought to develop and integrate emission reduction technologies for diesel locomotives and rail vehicles.", "In 2004, the European Commission amended the Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) Directive, putting railway engines within its scope. Stage\u00a0III\u00a0B standards as far as railcars and locomotives are concerned represent a major step in terms of engine and after-treatment technology. However, specific issues regarding the emission reduction technologies such as additional weight and space, reliability and waste heat are posing major concerns.\n\nTackling the technical challenges that need to be solved to comply with this new regulation has been the objective of the EU-funded project 'Clean European rail - diesel' (http://www.cleaner-d.eu/ (CLEANER-D)). The project sought to achieve emission levels well below the Directive and be prepared for further upcoming regulations by evaluating the best possible innovative and hybrid solutions.\n\nCLEANER-D demonstrated the feasibility and reliability in service of railway rolling stock powered with diesel engines compliant with Stage\u00a0III\u00a0B. To achieve this, it equipped an existing railcar and a locomotive with low-emission diesel engines. Another task involved installing a new-generation Stage\u00a0III\u00a0B-compliant prototype engine in a newly designed locomotive.\n\nProject members also evaluated the potential for further emission reduction to help the EU decide on future stages beyond the Stage\u00a0III\u00a0B. State-of-the-art and innovative after-treatment technologies were examined, including selective catalytic reaction and exhaust gas recirculation, through developing a 560\u00a0kW engine model. Another activity was to investigate potential use of alternative fuels such as biodiesel for further reducing emissions.\n\nHybridisation of diesel vehicles, a medium- and long-term technology for reducing carbon dioxide and other pollutants was also included. CLEANER-D evaluated the potential for energy savings by implementing different energy storage technologies. Studies on the most promising hybridisation solutions led to the most appropriate propulsion system architecture with appropriate energy management.\n\nBy running trials under operational conditions, CLEANER-D demonstrated that the engine industry can deliver reliable and affordable diesel engines suitable for railway applications. Due to the legal obligations, a high market uptake of project developments is ensured. Therefore, rail\u2013diesel traction looks set to remain an efficient and environmentally friendly option for Europe's railway sector.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2015-06/150093.jpg", "fp7_91307_996617286"], ["6QF", "Libralato Engine Prototype", "The Engine Consultancy Limited", "The Libralato rotary engine is a potential breakthrough technology, an \u201ceco-engine\u201d for the 21st century, with a new thermodynamic cycle and very different mechanical dynamics than is the case with conventional internal combustion engines. The project will investigate the design potential of the Libralato engine through an iterative cycle of simulation and modeling, prototype construction and test bed evaluation. The main claims made about the Libralato engine are:\n\n1)  Only 4 principal moving parts: leading rotor , following rotor, sliding connecting vane, rotating exhaust port - dynamically balanced with exceptionally low vibration.\n\n2)  New Libralato thermodynamic cycle based on gas exchange between three chamber interfaces.\n\n3)  Predicted 9% absolute efficiency increase (30% CO2 reduction relative to 30% efficient gasoline engine and 22% reduction relative to 40% efficient diesel engine).\n\n4)  Predicted 4% thermal efficiency increase due to asymmetrical compression and expansion volumes.\n\n5)  Predicted 5% mechanical efficiency increase due to rotary design - torque transferred directly to output shaft.\n\n6)  Predicted to exceed Euro 6 emission standards due to longer and more complete combustion phase, homogeneous type fuel air mixing, complete scavenge of residual exhaust gas and lower demand on after treatment.\n\n7)  Predicted 50% size and weight reduction due to rotary design (similar to Wankel).\n\n8)  Predicted 30% reduction in cost due to: reduced mass, elination of con-rods, crankshafts, valvetrains, camshafts etc and reduced manufacturing tolerances.\n\n9)  Predicted 50% reduction in noise due to rotary design and low velocity exhaust gas.\n\nThe consortium comprises 2 academic partners and 6 industrial partners plus an Industrial Advisory Group (Deutz AG, SMTC UK, JCB, Mahindra and BAE Systems) providing a balance of research expertise, SME business innovation skills and commercial exploitation capability.", 156097.0, 2053639.0, "LIBRALATO", "Revolutionary new engine tested", "Scientists are testing a new type of car engine that is smaller, more fuel efficient and more environmentally friendly than conventional internal combustion engines.", "The Libralato engine was invented and patented more than 20 years ago, but has never been built and tested. It is a rotary engine that could address growing demand for a light, low-emissions engine for light passenger vehicles.\n\nFunded by the EU, the 'Libralato engine prototype' (http://www.libralato.co.uk (LIBRALATO)) project aims to test the Libralato engine concept by building and testing a series of simulations, models and prototype engines.\n\nProject members started by constructing a 25\u00a0kW prototype engine based on the original design. Thermal and mechanical analyses of this prototype revealed the engine would function better at lower power.\n\nA 15\u00a0kW prototype with several rotors (to provide equivalent power output) has been designed and tested using modelling software. This design is more efficient and promises to be more stable in the long term. Researchers have also designed an engine management system using commercially available controllers. The software changes required for engine management have also been completed and tested successfully.\n\nBased on simulations of the 15\u00a0kW engine, LIBRALATO researchers predict a 50\u00a0% reduction in size, weight and cost when compared to an equivalent internal combustion engine. They also expect reductions in emissions and improved efficiency overall.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/143533.jpg", "fp7_101446_996617286"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WA15"}
