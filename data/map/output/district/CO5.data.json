In micro-systems, the costs of packaging can be up to 80% of total production costs. Technological advances to reduce packaging costs are therefore of pivotal importance to maintain the competitive edge of assembly companies. Moreover, with the exodus of high volume packaging and assembly companies to low-wage countries such as China and India, the manufacturing industry in Europe needs to revitalise itself by encouraging design and innovation that will allow European companies to produce assembly equipment and materials of tomorrow that will feed into the Asian market. Our approach of using microwave technology in bonding has significant advantages over technologies made available in the market. In our approach we don\u2019t need a closed microwave oven. Through the open design we can do the placement, alignment and curing at the same time. The use of this technology in reel-to-reel manufacturing will be possible. Due to the higher level of integration and signifcantly shorter cycle times this new technology will give European packaging companies a clear competitive advantage particularly over their US competitors. Quality of the bonds will be improved as well due to better selectivity and special designed materials as well as the precisely adaptable frequency of the microwave. It uses pulsed microwave sources and relies on the selection of a few resonant cavities frequencies that are jittered (mode hopping). The two characteristics permit not only the avoidance of electrical discharges through arcing, but also the accurate curing of the paste at the location of interest, i.e. at the interface between a die and the substrate for example in the case of DCA. The project is driven bei 6 SME-IAGs who want to create this clear competitive advantage for theirmembers.", 115407.0, 1998796.0, "FAMOBS", "New bonding technology for microelectronics", "EU-funded scientists unveiled an innovative microwave system not to heat food, but for use in the semiconductor industry to improve materials bonding quality.", "The cost of packaging in microelectronics accounts for 30\u00a0% of total production costs. However, this is rising at an alarming rate because of increasing consumer demand for smaller and smarter portable electronic devices. Technological advances to reduce packaging costs are therefore of crucial importance to maintain the competitive edge of EU packaging and assembly companies.\n\nMicroelectronics packaging often makes use of thermosetting polymer materials such as encapsulants, underfills or electrically conductive adhesives. Initially, thermosetting polymers are liquid or paste-like and are hardened through a curing process. An alternative approach to conventional heating methods is the use of microwave energy that results in substantially shorter curing times.\n\nIn the EU-funded project 'Frequency agile microwave bonding system' (http://www.famobs.eu/ (FAMOBS)), researchers developed a novel tool that uses pulsed microwave radiation and selects a few cavity frequencies to improve the bonding quality. Possible applications include curing underfill materials, bonding components to a printed circuit board or even reworking defective components.\n\nThis tool is an open-cavity bonding system that allows point selective heating. As such, it can be integrated into a precision placement machine to allow processing single components in a whole printed circuit board. Furthermore, the open design enables simultaneous placement, alignment and curing. Reel-to-reel processing is another application of this technology.\n\nCompared to a convection oven, the material is heated from the inside, which results in shorter curing times. It is thus possible to cure certain materials 10 times faster. The system has a process accuracy of less than 10\u00a0micrometres.\n\nWith the exodus of a high volume of packaging and assembly companies to low-wage countries, it becomes clear that the European manufacturing industry needs to revitalise itself. Due to the significantly shorter cycle times, this newly developed technology is expected to provide European packaging companies a clear competitive advantage. It should also allow them to produce assembly equipment and materials that will feed into the Asian market.", null, "http://www.freshfieldmicrowave.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/153658.jpg", "fp7_95601_974138409"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8UN", "FREE!
