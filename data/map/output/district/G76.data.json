The target group is SMEs and specifically those from the 50 \u2013 150 employee level. Within this target group, those organisations with high growth potential will be prioritised. The primary development focus will be on operation models which reflect the High Mix Low Volume (HMLV) manufacturing environment which companies must migrate towards in order to survive and compete. The project will address competitiveness issues relating to European SMEs, the lack of take up of productivity methodologies such as Lean and Six Sigma and the changing nature of the business environment in which SMEs operate. A comprehensive response will be generated which will deliver and demonstrate solutions for SMEs in relation to strategic planning, cultural and structural issues preventing adoption of best practices, modified lean and six sigma tools tailored for SME businesses, virtual manufacturing and collaboration methods, value chain enhancement methods, process modelling and simulation tools, implementation methodologies within SME organisations, design for environment support tools and workflow process development tools for SMEs. In addition, a special task will pilot and test how lean, six sigma and environmental philosophies can be integrated into school curricula in order to influence the mindset of future employees towards best practice business philosophies. The manufacturing model will be thoroughly tested through application in SMEs and other companies across a number of manufacturing sectors and also within several countries. Results will be disseminated widely across the EU and the outputs will be exploited for the benefit of SMEs across Europe.", 59225.0, 6896442.0, "FUTURESME", "Sustainable business model for SMEs", "The 'Future industrial model for SMEs' (FutureSME) project has developed a new, practical business and manufacturing model for small- and medium-sized enterprises across Europe. This model will help companies to compete more effectively at the national, European and global level by encouraging them to adopt sustainable business practices.", "FutureSME is carrying out research into the needs of SMEs, resulting in the development of a business model and project architecture. The model has identified four areas of capability that are required by a business in order for it to be successful. These include strategic, operational, managerial and adaptive capabilities, of which the adaptive capability is the most important for ensuring long-term sustainability.\n\nTransforming an SME into an adaptive enterprise is the job of the FutureSME architecture. This comprises a web portal, business diagnostics, resources to help with implementation, and a structured programme leading to accreditation. The business diagnostics have already been implemented for some end-user partners, while a self-assessment version is under development.\n\nThe support environment contains a number of productivity methodologies such as Lean materials, a life-cycle tool set and 6 Sigma (business management strategy) for SMEs. A modified architecture for schools has also been piloted by the FutureSME initiative that will encourage youngsters to develop a best practice business philosophy.\n\nTools, techniques and the delivery platform developed in FutureSME will enable organisations to boost their ability to adapt. The manufacturing model will be rigorously tested in SMEs and other companies across a number of manufacturing sectors within several countries.\n\nResults from FutureSME will be disseminated across the EU helping small- and medium-sized enterprises across Europe develop a sustainable business model. This model will enable companies to both reduce their environmental impacts and become wealth creators.", "http://www.futuresme.eu", "http://www.linn.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2011-03/46153.jpg", "fp7_89922_998817537"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7TX", "Embedding French Language and Culture at Carolside Primary School", "Carolside Primary School", 7553.0, "Our project has the context of the Scottish Government\u2019s 1 plus 2 language strategy at its heart. In Carolside Primary, we currently deliver French in a modular way and have already focused curriculum development work on our chosen \u2018plus 2\u2019 language, Mandarin.\r\n \r\nThe objectives of our project are:\r\n\u2022 To improve the learning and teaching of French in Carolside Primary School.\r\n\u2022 To improve teacher confidence in delivering French throughout the school day\r\n\u2022 To create new resources, implement different teaching methods and enhance the use of ICT to engage pupils in language learning.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 key members of staff who are involved in this application:\r\n\u2022 A current nursery class teacher, fluent in French and has experience of delivering the French curriculum to pupils working at Early, First and Second level of the curriculum. \r\n\u2022 A Primary 6 class teacher who has run the school's Languages Club for the past two years and has experience of delivering modern language lessons in Mandarin to pupils working at First and Second level of the curriculum. \r\n\u2022 A Primary 7 class teacher who has undertaken additional training in teaching French in the primary classroom and has been responsible for delivering the French curriculum to Primary 6 and Primary 7 classes in the school. \r\n\u2022 A Primary 6 class teacher who has undertaken a research project on the Scottish Government policy of 'Languages 1 + 2' and has begun additional French training this year.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out this project, and after having carried out detailed planning with staff and pupils at the school, we will attend an immersion course in Lyon specifically designed for primary teachers. This course will enable us to learn language specific skills and teaching pedagogy as well as to increase our cultural awareness of France. On returning to school, it is our intention to pass on these skills and knowledge to our colleagues in school and allow our pupils to benefit from our deeper understanding of French and life in France. \r\n\r\nWe envisage there to be a measurable change in the way French is delivered across the school and nursery as a result of our project. We aim for French to be embedded in daily teaching, for French and French culture to be linked to stage specific learning experiences, for the perception of language learning to be improved and for the school and local community to see language learning as a vital life and work skill for pupils as they progress to higher education. In the longer term, the school will be seen to be an example of how language learning can be successfully integrated in to daily teaching. Pupils will be confident in learning language(s) and therefore be equipped with the skills needed to be employed in a world where language skills are becoming essential.", "https://blogs.glowscotland.org.uk/er/Carolside/about-2/", "Carolside Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035736_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G76"}
