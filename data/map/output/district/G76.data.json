The target group is SMEs and specifically those from the 50 \u2013 150 employee level. Within this target group, those organisations with high growth potential will be prioritised. The primary development focus will be on operation models which reflect the High Mix Low Volume (HMLV) manufacturing environment which companies must migrate towards in order to survive and compete. The project will address competitiveness issues relating to European SMEs, the lack of take up of productivity methodologies such as Lean and Six Sigma and the changing nature of the business environment in which SMEs operate. A comprehensive response will be generated which will deliver and demonstrate solutions for SMEs in relation to strategic planning, cultural and structural issues preventing adoption of best practices, modified lean and six sigma tools tailored for SME businesses, virtual manufacturing and collaboration methods, value chain enhancement methods, process modelling and simulation tools, implementation methodologies within SME organisations, design for environment support tools and workflow process development tools for SMEs. In addition, a special task will pilot and test how lean, six sigma and environmental philosophies can be integrated into school curricula in order to influence the mindset of future employees towards best practice business philosophies. The manufacturing model will be thoroughly tested through application in SMEs and other companies across a number of manufacturing sectors and also within several countries. Results will be disseminated widely across the EU and the outputs will be exploited for the benefit of SMEs across Europe.", 59225.0, 6896442.0, "FUTURESME", "Sustainable business model for SMEs", "The 'Future industrial model for SMEs' (FutureSME) project has developed a new, practical business and manufacturing model for small- and medium-sized enterprises across Europe. This model will help companies to compete more effectively at the national, European and global level by encouraging them to adopt sustainable business practices.", "FutureSME is carrying out research into the needs of SMEs, resulting in the development of a business model and project architecture. The model has identified four areas of capability that are required by a business in order for it to be successful. These include strategic, operational, managerial and adaptive capabilities, of which the adaptive capability is the most important for ensuring long-term sustainability.\n\nTransforming an SME into an adaptive enterprise is the job of the FutureSME architecture. This comprises a web portal, business diagnostics, resources to help with implementation, and a structured programme leading to accreditation. The business diagnostics have already been implemented for some end-user partners, while a self-assessment version is under development.\n\nThe support environment contains a number of productivity methodologies such as Lean materials, a life-cycle tool set and 6 Sigma (business management strategy) for SMEs. A modified architecture for schools has also been piloted by the FutureSME initiative that will encourage youngsters to develop a best practice business philosophy.\n\nTools, techniques and the delivery platform developed in FutureSME will enable organisations to boost their ability to adapt. The manufacturing model will be rigorously tested in SMEs and other companies across a number of manufacturing sectors within several countries.\n\nResults from FutureSME will be disseminated across the EU helping small- and medium-sized enterprises across Europe develop a sustainable business model. This model will enable companies to both reduce their environmental impacts and become wealth creators.", "http://www.futuresme.eu", "http://www.linn.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2011-03/46153.jpg", "fp7_89922_998817537"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G76"}
