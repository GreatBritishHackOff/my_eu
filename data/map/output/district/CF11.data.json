Contemporary solutions involve BI users dealing with increasingly complex analyses. According to a 2008 study, the complexity of BI tools is the biggest barrier for success of these systems. Moreover, classical BI solutions have, so far, neglected the meaning of data.Semantic Technologies (STs), deal with this meaning and are capable of dealing with both unstructured and structured data. Having the meaning of data in place, a user can be guided during his work with data. In particular, we foresee FCA (Formal Concept Analysis), which is a well known ST, to be a key element of new hybrid BI system. However, STs have, traditionally, operated on data sets a magnitude smaller than classical BI solutions. They also lack standard BI functionalities such as Online Analytical Processing queries, making it difficult to perform analysis over semantic data. On the other hand, &apos;understanding data&apos; will improve classical methods in BI-CUBIST combines essential features of ST and BI. We envision a system with the following core features:* It supports federation of data from a variety of unstructured and structured sources,* The persistency layer is an Information Warehouse; having a BI enabled triple store in its center,* Semantic information is used to improve BI best practices,* CUBIST enables a user to perform BI operations over semantic data,* Semantic data warehouse is used to realize advance mining techniques known from, in particular FCA.* Novel ways of applying visual analytics in which meaningful diagrammatic representations of the data will be used for representing, navigating through and visually querying the data.<br/>CUBIST has three use cases in the fields of market intelligence, computational biology and control centre operations.", 179811.0, 3686015.0, "CUBIST", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_95904_985560353"], ["9LJ", "Protecting the health of Europeans by improving methods for the detection of pathogens in drinking water and water used in food preparation", "Public Health Wales National Health Service Trust", "The AQUAVALENS consortium has brought together SMEs, Industries, Universities and Research Institutes with the mission of protecting the health of European Citizens from contaminated drinking water and water used in food processing. We will achieve this by developing sustainable technologies to enable water system managers whether in large or small water systems or within food growers or manufacturers to better control the safety of their water supplies. The work of the project is divided into four main clusters of work packages that sequentially lead to the development of appropriate technologies. These four clusters are: 1. Platform targets, 2. Platform development, 3. Field studies in European drinking water systems, and 4. Improving Public Health through safer water. In cluster 1 we shall generate new knowledge on the molecular genetics of viral, bacterial and parasitic waterborne pathogens. This will enable us to identify gene targets for the identification, and characterisation of these pathogens, that will also enable the determination of their virulence for humans. In cluster 2 we shall use the knowledge gained to develop new technologies that integrate sample preparation and detection into a single platform. These platforms will then be subject to a rigorous process of validation and standardisation. In cluster 3 we will use the validated platforms to undertake a series of field studies in large and small drinking water systems, and in food production. These field studies will generate new knowledge about the risk to public health from waterborne pathogens in Europe and also test the value of the technologies in the field. Finally in cluster 4 we test how these technologies can be used to protect human health, though improving the effectiveness of Water Safety Plans, adaptation to climate change, and control of outbreaks of infectious disease. We will also determine the sustainability and potential economic impacts of these technologies.", 219928.0, 9700693.0, "Aquavalens", "Detecting waterborne pathogens", "The health of Europeans will soon be improved by a set of state-of-the-art tests that can rapidly detect disease-causing pathogens in Europe's water supplies.", "Although the EU has high water safety standards, thousands of Europeans fall sick each year from drinking water contaminated with bacteria, viruses and parasites. Identifying the presence of pathogens prior to water consumption is a challenge exacerbated by countless small water suppliers that are difficult to monitor.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.aquavalens.org (AQUAVALENS) (Protecting the health of Europeans by improving methods for the detection of pathogens in drinking water and water used in food preparation) project is developing accurate tests for rapidly identifying waterborne pathogens.\n\nAQUAVALENS is standardising ways to monitor water safety from varying sources like treated drinking water, groundwater or water used to produce food. Importantly, researchers are using cutting-edge science to pinpoint the presence of microbes and parasites while simultaneously determining if they can cause disease.\n\nThey are doing this by identifying the genes that enable viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens to cause disease. After developing ways to detect these disease-related genes in the water, their methods will be tested in water treatment systems and in food processing plants.\n\nIn addition to identifying disease-causing genes, researchers are also developing indicators of faecal pollution in water and, importantly, trace its source.

These CAs, which are often rare diseases, are a major cause of infant mortality, childhood morbidity and long-term disability. \nEUROCAT is an established European network of population-based registries for the epidemiologic surveillance of CAs. EUROlinkCAT will use the EUROCAT infrastructure to support 21 EUROCAT registries in 13 European countries to link their CA data to mortality, hospital discharge, prescription and educational databases. Each registry will send standard aggregate tables and analysis results to a Central Results Repository (CRR) thus respecting data security issues surrounding sensitive data. The CRR will contain standardised summary data and analyses on an estimated 200,000 children with a CA born from 1995 to 2014 up to age 10, enabling hypotheses on their health and education to be investigated at an EU level. This enhanced information will allow optimisation of personalised care and treatment decisions for children with rare CAs. \nRegistries will be supported in using social media platforms to connect with families who live with CAs in their regions. A novel sustainable e-forum, \u201cConnectEpeople\u201d, will link these families with local, national and international registries and information resources. ConnectEpeople will involve these families in setting research priorities and ensuring a meaningful dissemination of results.\nFindings will provide evidence to inform national treatment guidelines, such as concerning screening programs, to optimise diagnosis, prevention and treatment for these children and reduce health inequalities in Europe.
