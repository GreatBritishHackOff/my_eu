Contemporary solutions involve BI users dealing with increasingly complex analyses. According to a 2008 study, the complexity of BI tools is the biggest barrier for success of these systems. Moreover, classical BI solutions have, so far, neglected the meaning of data.Semantic Technologies (STs), deal with this meaning and are capable of dealing with both unstructured and structured data. Having the meaning of data in place, a user can be guided during his work with data. In particular, we foresee FCA (Formal Concept Analysis), which is a well known ST, to be a key element of new hybrid BI system. However, STs have, traditionally, operated on data sets a magnitude smaller than classical BI solutions. They also lack standard BI functionalities such as Online Analytical Processing queries, making it difficult to perform analysis over semantic data. On the other hand, &apos;understanding data&apos; will improve classical methods in BI-CUBIST combines essential features of ST and BI. We envision a system with the following core features:* It supports federation of data from a variety of unstructured and structured sources,* The persistency layer is an Information Warehouse; having a BI enabled triple store in its center,* Semantic information is used to improve BI best practices,* CUBIST enables a user to perform BI operations over semantic data,* Semantic data warehouse is used to realize advance mining techniques known from, in particular FCA.* Novel ways of applying visual analytics in which meaningful diagrammatic representations of the data will be used for representing, navigating through and visually querying the data.<br/>CUBIST has three use cases in the fields of market intelligence, computational biology and control centre operations.", 179811.0, 3686015.0, "CUBIST", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_95904_985560353"], ["9LJ", "Protecting the health of Europeans by improving methods for the detection of pathogens in drinking water and water used in food preparation", "Public Health Wales National Health Service Trust", "The AQUAVALENS consortium has brought together SMEs, Industries, Universities and Research Institutes with the mission of protecting the health of European Citizens from contaminated drinking water and water used in food processing. We will achieve this by developing sustainable technologies to enable water system managers whether in large or small water systems or within food growers or manufacturers to better control the safety of their water supplies. The work of the project is divided into four main clusters of work packages that sequentially lead to the development of appropriate technologies. These four clusters are: 1. Platform targets, 2. Platform development, 3. Field studies in European drinking water systems, and 4. Improving Public Health through safer water. In cluster 1 we shall generate new knowledge on the molecular genetics of viral, bacterial and parasitic waterborne pathogens. This will enable us to identify gene targets for the identification, and characterisation of these pathogens, that will also enable the determination of their virulence for humans. In cluster 2 we shall use the knowledge gained to develop new technologies that integrate sample preparation and detection into a single platform. These platforms will then be subject to a rigorous process of validation and standardisation. In cluster 3 we will use the validated platforms to undertake a series of field studies in large and small drinking water systems, and in food production.

We are aware that our children are growing up in a fast changing world & are keen to prepare them for the world of work. In the last 2 years we have heavily invested in the latest IT technologies, particularly i-pads, which we have integrated throughout the curriculum. We have shared our experiences with schools but now wish to gain more innovative ideas from European countries & expand our teaching into the fields of coding & programming. We have identified staff training needs in order to stay ahead of the curve. We expect our newly acquired knowledge to improve standards of teaching & deliver high quality learning outcomes for the children.\r\nFamily Engagement (FE). We are situated within a diverse community. In recent years the profile of our school has changed & we have noted increased numbers of disengaged parents. This has the knock-on negative effect within the school of learner behaviours, & decreasing attendance figures. \r\n\r\nWe have 2 key objectives: - Keep up to date with developments within the field of Emerging Technologies to effectively teach our staff, pupils & local community & engaging \u2018hard to reach\u2019 parents.\r\n\r\nParticipants:- ET - Our ICT coordinators & E Learning leaders have successfully managed the implementation of iPads throughout the school & established a valuable group of pupil Digital Leaders. Both are highly motivated & have a particular interest in & knowledge of ICT. Their infectious enthusiasm has inspired other teachers to engage with new technologies. Due their prior experience of delivering high quality training sessions & on-going technical support, we feel confident that they will be able to effectively cascade this newly acquired knowledge through to all of our staff & pupils. \r\nFE- Our long serving Headteacher (our former Early Years coordinator) will attend FE in Early Years course. She is the ideal candidate because of her experience in; establishing excellent relationships with parents & families, Foundation Phase practice & studying of Emilia Reggio. Our School Improvement Plan reflects the increase in disengaged parents & we have highlighted the need to rejuvenate our efforts to engage them. Engaging hard to reach parents has been proven to have a disproportionately positive effect on student learning & achievement & also combat several poverty & deprivation issues surrounding education. Therefore we will be appointing & investing in a Family Engagement Officer (FEO) who will accompany the Head on this course. We are hopeful that this visit will inspire our FEO as he/she begins this vitally important role for our school. \r\n\r\nDescription of activities:- 1. Our ICT Coordinator & E. Learning Leader are to attend a course on Emerging Technologies in Croatia focusing on i-pads, coding & programming. They will be shown how their effective teaching & learning can impact on raising the attainment of their pupils. This will enable our staff to network with IT experts from other European countries to improve their own ICT teaching. 2. Our Deputy Headteacher & newly appointed Family Liaison Officer are to attend a course on Family Engagement in Early Years, Reggio, Italy. Italy is a renowned centre of excellence for Early Years education & is known for it's ability to foster excellent, trusting & supportive relationships with parents & intergenerational family members. We will also be exploring a Reggio setting whilst in Italy to observe first-hand how they are able to successfully engage their parents in their child's learning process & reduce unauthorised absences.\r\n\r\nMethodology:- In Croatia; \"there are more teachers using ICT in more than 25% of lessons, above the EU average; student use of computers in class is above the EU mean & more students are in schools where teachers have spent between 1&3 days on ICT professional level.\" (Survey of Schools: ICT Education, 2012). Family Engagement; \"In the primary age range the impact caused by different levels of parental involvement is much bigger than differences associated with variations in the quality of schools. The scale of the impact is evident across all social classes and all ethnic groups.\" (Desforges 2003).\r\n\r\nResults & Long Term Benefits:- The purchase & implementation of emerging technologies & strategies as observed & studied on course in Croatia; the monitoring & evaluation of ICT lessons;  engage pupils in consultation of their opinions on the ICT improvements; the attendance & feedback of Intergenerational workshop; children's increased levels of basic skills & ICT standards throughout the school.

It is a global business and global labour market. There is fierce competition, not only domestically, but internationally as well. In England in 2013-14 the top eight Premier League clubs made 44 new signings and 33 of these players were foreign. Staggeringly in 2013-14 just five English players took part in all 38 Premier League matches. Currently, 93% of players at English academies are British but less than 25% of new players signed by Premier League clubs in 2013-14 were UK nationals. Clearly, our academy players are not making the transition to first team status as efficiently as our European competitors, which supports the Welsh FA\u2019s desire to study European coaching practice. \r\n\r\nThe Welsh FA\u2019s previous participation in the Leonardo da Vinci mobility programme has demonstrated the undoubted potential for mobility to enhance the employment prospects for young apprentices (VET learners). Between 15-20% of all mobility participants went on to achieve first team status, which is an unprecedented success rate and directly attributable to the benefits of mobility. By contrast, in the absence of mobility, only 5-8% of apprentices can expect to achieve first team promotion.  One of the great value-added benefits of mobility participation is the finding that apprentices who are unsuccessful in being offered a professional contract are still four times more likely to be offered employment in a secondary career pathway than those who have not undertaken mobility. \r\n\r\nMobility will allow 65 male and female elite players to experience the training methods at three UEFA-acknowledged centres of excellence in Austria, Spain and Portugal. The host partners will provide access to different European teams and coaching systems, which are each applauded as having world class records in talent identification, coupled with innovative coaching and enhanced player-development pathways.  Innovations in physiological development, coaching delivery and tactical analysis will be used to improve skills\u2019 acquisition for mobility participants.
