However, this cell transplantation approach has given inconsistent results, with some patients doing extremely well and coming off anti-PD medication for years, whilst others have shown no or only modest clinical improvements, and in some cases also developed severe, off-state graft-induced dyskinesias (GIDs). The reasons behind this heterogeneity of outcomes, and the emergence of GIDs in particular, need to be better understood, not least in the perspective of the rapid advances that are now being made in the development of stem-cell based therapies. There is therefore an urgent need to revisit the trials that have already been done with fetal VM tissue in PD patients, with the expectation that a critical reassessment can form the basis for an optimised and more standardised procedure that will translate into more consistently efficacious transplants with minimal side-effects. Over the last two years a group of international experts, including the key investigators of the previous European and North American trials, has been re-examining the outcome of these trials as well as reviewing the results obtained from recent and ongoing animal experimental studies, and identified a number of weaknesses that may explain the inconsistent outcome in previous trials. As a result of these discussions, the group has agreed to join forces in a new round of experimental work and cell therapy trials in PD, based on a new jointly developed protocol where all these factors are taken into account. In the first instance fetal VM tissue containing mesencephalic DA neuroblasts will be used, with the expectation that this will pave the way for bigger trials using dopaminergic neurons derived from stem cells.", 645448.0, 13189031.0, "TRANSEURO", "Honing protocols for Parkinson's stem cell therapy", "Current research is fine-tuning stem cell-based treatments to achieve consistent benefits for patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD).", "Motor symptoms of PD are caused by death of dopamine-generating cells in the area of the brain known as the substantia nigra. Currently there is no cure for PD but one of the most successful reparative treatments is the use of foetal dopaminergic (DA) cell-based treatments.\n\nAllo-transplantation of DA neuroblasts obtained from foetal stem cells from ventral mesencephalic (VM) tissue has provided inconsistent results. Some patients do very well and others show only modest improvement of clinical symptoms. In some cases, however, the transplantee develops graft-induced dyskinesis (GID), abnormal involuntary movements.\n\nThe aim of the 'Neural transplantation in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease' (Transeuro) project is to develop a protocol for neural transplantation that would produce more consistent benefits for the patient and less damaging side-effects.\n\nTranseuro project results so far include a method of foetal tissue dissection and preparation that maximises DA cell survival within the transplant. Importantly, the ratio of DA to serotoninergic neuron is kept in favour of DA which minimises the risk of GID.\n\nTo aid information exchange and optimisation of future research, Transeuro set up a foetal tissue dissection database. Dissection parameters between groups can thus be compared which will help in the validation process.\n\nThe researchers have optimised the hibernation media  for tissue derived from VM cells prior to clinical use. All centres are now using tirilazad mesylate as a neuroprotective agent.\n\nStudies on GID have revealed that this side-effect only occurs in animals with pre-existing dyskinesis that is L-Dopa induced. The team also showed that prolonged storage of tissue only affects graft survival and not the development of GIDs.\n\nTranseuro has already started recruitment for the clinical programme where subjects are less than 65 years old and without L-Dopa\u2013induced dyskinesis or other significant cognitive deficits or medical illnesses. After 12 months of monitoring in an observational study, they are eligible for a neural graft.\n\nProject scientists have achieved success in the aims and objectives of the first part of the programme.

To keep the latter affordable, drug development should become more efficient and drug treatment should become more \u201cpersonalized\u201d and \u201crationalized\u201d. Molecular imaging can play a pivotal role in changing the landscape of drug design/development and improving the health care system. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, in particular, is the technology that has the potential to lead this fundamental innovation by providing at a much earlier stage reliable answers to key questions emerging during the care cycle: what and where is the disease? Is the disease accurately targeted by the therapy? Is the treatment effective? By answering the questions above, PET imaging has the capacity to render much more effectively the transition from pre-clinical to clinical phase, and to strongly facilitate the development of better drugs at an earlier stage and in a much more sustainable manner. The main obstacle to this change of paradigm in drug design and development is the lack of suitably trained translational scientists directly involved in PET imaging and imaging scientists with high-profile training in chemistry and PET-radiochemistry, which is particularly dramatic in Europe. This consortium is ideally suited to fill this gap, by providing top-quality training to the next generation of translational PET imaging scientists who will play a key role in shaping the future of drug design and development.
