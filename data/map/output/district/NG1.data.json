The concepts of these multifunctional tapes are far behind the electrical insulating state of the art. The project aims to develop a new process chain leading to a drastic improvement of insulating tape structure homogeneity. The today\u2019s limitations of tape come from its heterogeneous multilayer structure bringing together very different materials like glass fibre fabric, mica flakes and polymers. Enabling this homogenisation requires higher performance materials, which will be obtained by adjunct of inorganic nanofillers according to two proposed development routes: nanodielectrics polymer or inorganic polymers (sol-gel). This will lead to a more robust process chain with a better productivity (\\50%) and an insulating tape with enhanced performances like a higher field strength (\\40%), a better thermal conduction (\\60%). At the end, a much thinner tape (-30%) enabling the design of more compact generators is expected. This project can strongly impact the energy production field.

They looked at how to develop and test a new production model involving different small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that can work together as microfactories under one network.

It then defined customisation options and developed several product configuration paradigms for different project partners to meet their needs. Work also involved integrating customer support functions, style advice for customers and virtual try-on capabilities that involved 3D representation.\n\nTo help launch this vision, SERVIVE built an http://community.servive.eu (online portal and community) that lets consumers buy mass-customised clothing items from different suppliers.

Finally, the mobility project is intended for teachers and staff to learn about the practical use of the foreign language and experience its use in professional situations, as well as improve their teaching while up-dating and up-skilling their knowledge through new methodologies.\r\n\r\nThis project will be deployed in 12 months, and it will be organised in the following phases:\r\nPRE-PHASE: Vernon will create the program of the stay cooperatively with Cesur, Code of Conduct, Learning Agreements for the staff mobility, Partnership Agreements between Vernon CC and Cesur.\r\nSELECTION PHASE: Vernon will publish and disseminate the Erasmus+ call, so as to receive applications from teachers, administrative and management staff, and arouse curiosity among all potential participants.\r\nPREPARATION PHASE: Cesur and Vernon will discuss the details of the programme. PractiGo will research which possibilities there are to accommodate Vernon teachers and staff in Malaga. Finally, Vernon will organise an information meeting prior to mobility to give some clues to the teachers and staff involved about language, culture, weather and environment of the host training centre in Spain, Cesur.\r\nMOBILITY PERIOD: The main topics of the training event organised by Cesur in Malaga will be: the Spanish educational system, how to deal with foreign students and show empathy, Spanish culture, IT and Food, IT and employability, customer service and European-orientated further training.\r\nFINAL PHASE: Vernon will organise the final workshop, where participants will exchange their experiences abroad, gather acquired competences and analyse how they can be applied at work in the college, analyse the learning process followed abroad, share proposals for improvement for next potential mobility projects and share opinions and plan how Vernon is going to participate at European level in the near future.\r\n\r\nWe expect a great project impact at all levels. At the local, regional and national level, the desired impact will be: integration of more adults\u2019 education centres in the European dimension; creation of new international training offer; promotion of language learning among participants and their students; improvement of cross-cultural competence of the trainers participating in the project and their students; and encouragement of relations with other European countries, such as Spain.\r\nAt European/international level, the desired impact will be: improvement of the training offer quality; cultural learning from a country with high diversity and tourism; promotion of international cooperation at the level of training centres, trainers/teachers and students; and encourage the inclusion of language and cultural training as a basis to be integrated in a new community.", "http://www.vernoncc.co.uk", "vernon community college cic", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA104-036442_coordinator"], ["1FH", "Heritage Hunters", "City Arts (Nottingham) Ltd", 43292.0, "Together the partners of this project aim to promote cultural heritage among youth through innovative and artistic activities by means of a Study Visit consisting of 29 youth leaders and taking place in Chisinau, Moldova in November 2017 and a seminar consisting of 28 youth sector managers/facilitators/coordinators/experts, taking place in Nottingham, UK, in March 2018. \r\n\r\nArticle 3.3 of the Lisbon Treaty  states: \u201cThe Union shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and [...] ensure that Europe\u2019s cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe European commission, in their supportive cultural policy state 'Cultural heritage enriches the individual lives of citizens, is a driving force for the cultural and creative sectors, and plays a role in creating and enhancing Europe's social capital.\r\n\r\nIt is also an important resource for economic growth, employment and social cohesion, offering the potential to revitalise urban and rural areas and promote sustainable tourism.'\r\n\r\nThe partners of this project directly identify with this statement, and recognise their role as actors in assuring the commitment made in the Lisbon treaty.\r\n\r\nHowever, the partners, through their work, also recognise that young people live in a highly accelerated,  increasingly globalised society, which offers a wide range of activities worldwide never more than one click away. An effortless access to online information, socialisation, and media is constant, highly promoting an internationalised mainstream culture. This ever-evolving access to quick and easy information and social media culture, is reducing young people\u2019s connection to their cultural roots, sense of belonging and social capitol.\r\n\r\nIn The Republic of Moldova a strategic political effort and a network of local 'cultural houses' in all villages has successfully promoted and preserved the local traditions among young people. Young people are, on a large scale, engaging in traditional dance, handcrafts or music. In the local discos, between American mainstream music, you will still find that a traditional dance, the \"hora\" is getting most people on the dance floor. \r\n\r\nBy exploring this sense of cultural belonging in Moldova, the project partners intend to reflect on cultural heritage, and how the participation of youth in their own community and culture can be increased.\r\n\r\n Furthermore, the project is looking to build upon the experiences, share practices from partners and stakeholders, and develop common local and international strategies and methods for inventively promoting cultural heritage among youth in the EU.\r\n\r\nIn line with this, the project  aim is to promote cultural heritage among youth through innovative and artistic activities delivered by youth workers and youth organisations. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet this aim, the following objectives have been identified:\r\n1) Give  youth workers from 8 programme and partner countries examples of best practice of how to preserve and promote local heritage through artistic activities \r\n2) Make youth workers from 8 programme and partner countries reflect on the importance of cultural heritage in ensuring social capital and participation amongst youth\r\n3) Explore youth work practices in combining mainstream and traditional culture through art and entrepreneurship\r\n4) Create artistic methods aiming at preserving and promoting cultural heritage among young people, with inputs from practices across 8 partner and programme countries\r\n5) Develop concrete strategies and common policies for promoting cultural heritage among young people with inputs from practices across 8 partner and programme countries\r\n6) Strengthen  and internationalise youth workers and youth organisations professional networks\r\n7) Create visibility, dissemination, and local impact through the project for promoting local heritage amongst youth in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe methods, strategies and policies developed through the project to promote cultural heritage amongst youth will be adopted and implemented within the overall strategies and policies of the partner organisations, ensuring the project results are followed up and exploited. Furthermore, the partners will promote these methods, strategies and policies to other organisations, educational institutions and local authorities with the aim of encouraging their widespread adoption\r\n\r\nThe partners will create a PDF booklet that will present the Methods, Strategies, and Policies created during the Seminar and the process undertaken to reach the results, including the study visit in the Republic of Moldova.
