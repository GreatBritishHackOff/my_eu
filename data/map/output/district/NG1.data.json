The concepts of these multifunctional tapes are far behind the electrical insulating state of the art. The project aims to develop a new process chain leading to a drastic improvement of insulating tape structure homogeneity. The today\u2019s limitations of tape come from its heterogeneous multilayer structure bringing together very different materials like glass fibre fabric, mica flakes and polymers. Enabling this homogenisation requires higher performance materials, which will be obtained by adjunct of inorganic nanofillers according to two proposed development routes: nanodielectrics polymer or inorganic polymers (sol-gel). This will lead to a more robust process chain with a better productivity (\\50%) and an insulating tape with enhanced performances like a higher field strength (\\40%), a better thermal conduction (\\60%). At the end, a much thinner tape (-30%) enabling the design of more compact generators is expected. This project can strongly impact the energy production field.

They looked at how to develop and test a new production model involving different small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that can work together as microfactories under one network.

It then defined customisation options and developed several product configuration paradigms for different project partners to meet their needs. Work also involved integrating customer support functions, style advice for customers and virtual try-on capabilities that involved 3D representation.\n\nTo help launch this vision, SERVIVE built an http://community.servive.eu (online portal and community) that lets consumers buy mass-customised clothing items from different suppliers.

Aventus is ready for this and by participating in European Profiles Aventus\u2019 students who distinguish themselves by making the choice of having a traineeship with one of Aventus\u2019 European partners will benefit from this new step by Aventus. The past 10 years Aventus has positioned and structured international traineeships solidly. First Aventus introduced an Aventus-wide organisation of Leonardo da Vinci mobility projects. After this Aventus\u2019 European network was strengthened, then Aventus respectively focused on linking the school\u2019s policy for specific needs\u2019 groups with its policy as to  international traineeships, assessing growth with intercultural competences, sustainable European partnerships and Aventus-wide implementation of innovations. The last two years Aventus started introducing ECVETcomponents. Because the translation of work processes to \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d has only been realized to a limited extent, it is still very complicated to get a reliable and valid assessment from practice tutors from foreign training companies. After this stage Aventus together with a number of its European partners aimed at preparation of the  implementation of ECVET in order to come to a matching assessment system. Aventus achieved this for the following 5 courses: Business and Economics (European Management Assistant), Trade (International Import and Export Assistant plus European Fashion Production Coordinator and European Fashion Designer),  Automotive Technique (EUROTRANSLOG for Transport and Logistics). Aventus focused on \u201clearning agreements\u201d and \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d with this exploration of ECVET. For this purpose Aventus also became a member of ECVET-proof networks:  the NETINVET networks for International Trade and Transport & Logistics, the EURO-AST network for secretarial professions and the EUrFASHION network for fashion. Together with its European partners Aventus is now creating the \"EEE\" network for green automotive technology with its own job profile for the automotive line of business. With \u201cEUROPRO\u201d Aventus aims at making the next step. All these networks work with European reference profiles. The next few years European Profiles as reference qualifications will be the focus for international traineeships for the courses mentioned above and also for Aventus\u2019 ICT and health care courses. With the help of transparent assessment and validation these European (Job) Profiles make sure that especially the growth in professional competences during international traineeships is safeguarded  and is realized with sufficient quality. The \u201coil slick\u201d of ECVET proof international traineeships within Aventus\u2019 European partnership is getting bigger and bigger in this way.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d expresses that Aventus has reached agreement with its partners on the content of the cooperation with student mobility and in the \u201clearning agreements\u201d of the participating students with these partners the learning aims of these students are stated. With these instruments recognition and validation of European traineeships  are safeguarded within \"EUROPRO\".  This not only happens with partners from the above-mentioned European networks but also in bilateral cooperation with Aventus\u2019 other European partners within EUROPRO and also for different courses. With these last cooperation forms the challenges are certainly bigger, because no ready-made European Profile has been drawn up yet. With these bilateral partnerships Aventus\u2019 teachers draw up the \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d together with their European partners and these can be used during \u201cEUROPRO\u201d traineeships and with international traineeships of reciprocal projects.

The students will visit new start-up businesses in Karlsruhe, and visit the Eunique Applied Arts International Trade Fair, University HfG, Design Museum, Karlsruhe Palace, Majolica Museum and Contemporary Art Galleries.  \r\n\r\nEach student will have an individual work placement during their visit in an area linked to their specialism; such as a fashion designer, an architect or a photographer.  This work placement will be the culmination of the student\u2019s preparation, where they will be able to draw upon their UK Mentoring, German language and team-building and interpersonal skills.  \r\n\r\nWelding \r\nThe beneficiaries of this project are welding learners enrolled at the College. They will go on 2-week placements to Germany. There would be four flows of participants with 10 students and two accompanying persons. \r\n \r\nThe project has been developed following a thorough consultation exercise with our local employers, who work closely with the College\u2019s welding department, and the successful outcomes from a previous project. Following on from the last project, our learners have excelled and new learners are eager to participate in a placement that would result in learning state of the art technology documented by a certificate, issued by the German partner.\r\n\r\nThe training content involves breakthrough welding technologies with laser and robotics. Upon successful completion of the placement, the German Host Partner, Bildungsgesellschaft mbH Pritzwalk, will issue a certificate for the participants in \u00b4Laser Welding Technologies and Robotics\u00b4.  Training with laser and robotic welding is not available at our college or similar colleges in the area; although it would enhance employment prospects for our apprentices within the large companies, which currently use laser and robots technology in welding applications.\r\n\r\nConstruction \r\nThe project will provide students from the Construction School at Central College Nottingham (areas: carpentry, bricklaying, groundworks, plumbing and electrical) with an opportunity to gain a two-week placement in the Czech Republic, Prague, with a vocational training college (Stredni skola technicka). There would be two flows of participants with 10 students and two accompanying persons. \r\n\r\nThe mobility includes training at the college on new methods of preservation and applying modern insulation methods to old buildings such as insulation and renewable energy-related technology e.g. solar. The flow will include work placements which will focus on heritage skills and preservation as well as cultural and work-related activities organised by the host partners. Additionally, the participants will complete a range of short units from a programme in Construction Heritage Skills. Heritage Skills cover specialist skills in a variety of construction trade areas.", "http://www.centralnottingham.ac.uk", "Nottingham College", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-013050_coordinator"], ["5AF", "Young Poetry across Borders - a European Encounter", "Mouthy Poets CIC", 16603.0, "Poetry Performance, the art of performing a self-written text to a public audience, empowers young people to stand and speak up for themselves and others. Often hardship and isolation from the 'norm' gives young people a story and a need for catharsis: there is no vocabulary for their experiences, so they must develop their own. Thus, the Mouthy Poets in Nottingham and #LoewenMaul in Braunschweig support young people to develop their personal, communication and professional skills and (intercultural) knowledge through the means of creative writing and performance as well as to enable them to produce and organise their own projects. This helps young people to identify who they are, to develop to who they want to be and to become who they never thought they were able to become through the support of both collectives. Creative independence and professional opportunities lead to employable, critical and engaged European citizens. \r\nThe Mouthy Poets, founded and led by their artistic director Deborah Stevenson, is a non-formal collective of 15+ year-olds with diverse backgrounds, differing in ethnicity, vocational status, gender, nationality and ability. In September 2013, Anne Hartmann from the Staatstheater Braunschweig and Deborah Stevenson created #LoewenMaul as a counterpart of the Mouthy Poets. The participants of #LoewenMaul are 15 year-olds and above. They share a similar diversity as the Mouthy Poets. In both groups there are participants with fewer opportunities facing social and economic obstacles as well as disability. \r\nAfter two staff exchanges and one participant exchange since 2013, we want to sustain and intensify this relationship with the Mouthy Poets by enabling both groups to collaborate fully with each other and directly in depth. We see the exchange that took place in April 2015 as a preparatory activity for the future exchanges we would like to carry out. It was also a chance to \u2018test the water\u2019 to see if participants from both sides could and were interested in working together and this is definitely the case. In our project \u00bbYoung Poetry across Borders - a European Encounter\u00ab, our main objectives are to open up possibilities of language and intercultural learning as well as widening the artistic scope and cultural awareness of the participants from both groups. We want to harness the personal and social development that comes via creative writing to empower the young Europeans and the staff to build a broader understanding of the European identity, of solidarity and tolerance, of intercultural dialogue and language awareness.\r\nFrom 24.10.-1.11.15 and in 17.-25.7.16, both groups will accomplish 2 Youth Exchanges between Germany and UK and the other way round. Each of them will last 7 days, excluding travel days. 20 Mouthy Poets will come to Braunschweig and 20 #LoewenMaul Poets will visit the Mouthy Poets in Nottingham. Both groups are invited to participate in and join a programme of different participatory activities, organised and curated by each group and their staff. Both exchanges will happen within a structured framework: at the premises of the Staatstheater Braunschweig and in Nottingham within Mouthy Poets\u2019 Poetry Performance Festival \u00bbSay Sum Thin 11\u00ab at the Nottingham Playhouse. We believe that the skills and experiences gained through creative writing and mutual support will have the most impact when they are performing and speaking out loud together to a public audience. The non-formal and informal learning will happen through facilitating workshops and different exercises for creative writing, editing and feedback, debates, hosting an open-mic as well as producing and presenting a poetry performance showcase together on one stage. Within that, we deliver peer-to-peer-learning-activities which target at language learning through poetry and city-specific exploration tasks where they write new poetry about the cities. These activities will be facilitated both by participants and group leaders of both groups as well as by staff of the Staatstheater Braunschweig. \r\nThe working methods used for both activities are: facilitating workshops, exercises and masterclasses in creative writing and performing; shadowing; formats of discussion (panel discussions, one-to-one-mentoring, peer-to-peer discussions); rehearsing; sharing creative feedback; filming as a means of evaluation; dancing; cooking together, reading local poetry; watching Eurovision Song contests and/or soccer games; intercultural city tours and other non-formal and informal activities. Beyond that, we want to acknowledge and validate the participants\u2019 commitment in the youth exchange and project, among others, in applying the Youthpass certificate. With our education and training through creative writing we want to provide all participating young Europeans with the necessary skills to shape and improve their possibilities for their future vocational education and career with confidence, pleasure and engagement.", "http://www.mouthypoets.com", null, "erasmus_2015-2-DE04-KA105-012951_1"], ["4BU", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIVERSITY", 489564.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.ntu.ac.uk", "THE NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-013152_coordinator"], ["7AQ", "Betriebspraktika in europ\u00e4ischen Unternehmen 2016 und 2017", "Weavers of Nottingham", 73331.0, "In 2016 and 2017, 29 participants of the biennial and triennial (see 1) vocational course of State-Certified Commercial Assistants for Foreign Languages, 10 participants of the so called \u2018dual educational courses\u2019 (see 2) of Personnel Service Providers, Insurers, Retailers, and 7 participants of the course of Foreign Language Correspondence Clerks/A-levels will take part in the internship programme.The Commercial Assistants who do their internship at the beginning of their last year of vocational studies then will have substantial demand of both, foreign languages in the field of commercial correspondence and terminology in foreign trade. They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics. In the latter they will have learned how to use computer programmes like Excel, Word and Powerpoint and will be well trained in word processing.Due to all these skills acquired, they are qualified for working in international importing and exporting enterprises, shipping companies, international industrial concerns and organisations as well as in hotels and/or language schools.At a time when their state of knowledge enables the trainees to deal with responsible tasks in a company or an institution, the internships offer the opportunity to link their theoretical knowledge with practical training. What concerns us primarily is that for teaching purposes didactically reduced case studies become verified in a real environment in order to enhance the students\u2019 chances on the European labour market.As this is a full-time vocational school training, the trainees have got few opportunities to work in side jobs to earn their own living. Thus, doing an internship in a foreign country does not only mean financial losses during the time of their stay but also considerable problems in raising the funds for a period abroad. Only if our trainees will be sponsored by the ERASMUS+ programme, we are able to realise our project which is continually carried out and supervised by qualified teachers experienced in this area.Moreover, this programme constitutes the frame of security, trustworthiness, approval and professional advice and support which is so important to our partners and beneficiaries.This year\u2019s project of 8 to 11 weeks will be carried out in companies and institutions based in the UK, France, Spain, Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and Turkey. An internship of eleven weeks including the corresponding exam held and certified by a German-French board of examiners will be offered by the grammar schools Lyc\u00e9e St. Etienne and Lyc\u00e9e Ren\u00e9-Cassin in Strasbourg.With that the students are given the opportunity to get their practical skills certified and, thus, to obtain a more favourable starting position on the labour market. For already three years now, we have been applying the ECVET instruments in co-operation with these partners. In recurrently held workshops we regularly update and adjust the instruments to the corresponding needs.All details described above are mainly applicable to the Foreign Language Correspondence Clerks/A-levels, except the fact that these students are at the initial stage of their vocational training at the time of their internship. The trainees of the dual educational courses benefit from their three-week internship by testing their practical knowledge in other European countries. The teachers draw upon this experience by improving the quality of their training and to provide the entire staff with the newly gained knowledge and competences. The participants of the project will benefit considerably and sustainably, both, in their professional and private life from the improvement of their language skills, newly gained cultural insights and, last but not least, their personality development. 1 The students of the triennial course do a combined degree course of AVCE and State-certified Commercial Assistant for Foreign Languages.2 Dual courses are a combination of theoretical vocational training at school and practical training in a company.", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002949_4"], ["1NG", "European Excellence", "Nottingham College", 104916.0, "The last 15 years Aventus invested much into sustainable relations with European partners.

This project involves 3 different schools of learning which have specific needs for each; however there are some common key overall objectives and expected results which apply for all. We would like to carry out this project to support our students in:- enhanced employability and improved career prospects through work experience and training in real work environments- gaining new skills through assessment & recognition of learning through new and innovative training - building confidence through working in new environments, - problem-solving skills through the preparation and independent living, - life skills through travel and meeting people of many nationalities and cultures, communication skills through interaction with    professionals in the UK and abroad, - basic language skills, cultural awareness of custom, history and economy through preparatory sessions and immersive experience - teamwork skills through working with participants from the College and partners, - transferable employment skills in resilience, commitment and reliability, validated via the EuroPass. Sports The sports stream of the project will focus on providing a core of the College's elite level footballers (Male & Female 16-19 yrs) with an opportunity to take part in two week professional training camp/work experience at Sportilia, Italy. The aim of the project will to increase the employability of participants leading to success as a professional footballer or gaining employment in a secondary career pathway. The objective of the camp would be to provide participants with an opportunity to learn new European training methods, techniques and philosophies whilst living and working as a professional footballer. This will include innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis. Additionally, regular training sessions will form part of the experience which will  address the defined sports performance targets set before the visit and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Participants will also take part in sessions based on lifestyle/nutrition, dealing with the media and post-match recovery.

Thanks to our participation in Leonardo in 2013, they could improve their social skills and learn how important and beneficial is to operate in different cultural settings, which will be a core competency for organizations over the next decade.\r\n\r\nVernon proposes this project in order to enrich our teaching staff and our training offer in many ways.\r\nConcerning our training staff, the main aims are: To improve their cross-cultural competences; To learn how to transmit their cross-cultural competences to their adult students; To improve their teaching and language skills; To up-date and up-skill their knowledge through new methodologies acquired in Spain; To exchange expertise with other professionals of their sector.\r\nRegarding our training centre/offer, the principal objectives are: To exchange best practices in the field of culture; To enrich and internationalize Vernon courses with the experience that our partner Cesur can provide; To understand better the functioning of other European organizations and bids and how to develop collaborations and synergies.\r\nThe overall aim is that our college, teachers and administrative staff work together to improve and strengthen our international dimension, in particular the European one, in adult education and training. Their stay in Spain is also intended to improve international cooperation with European partners and increase their communication and cooperation capacity at European level. Finally, the mobility project is intended for teachers and staff to learn about the practical use of the foreign language and experience its use in professional situations, as well as improve their teaching while up-dating and up-skilling their knowledge through new methodologies.\r\n\r\nThis project will be deployed in 12 months, and it will be organised in the following phases:\r\nPRE-PHASE: Vernon will create the program of the stay cooperatively with Cesur, Code of Conduct, Learning Agreements for the staff mobility, Partnership Agreements between Vernon CC and Cesur.\r\nSELECTION PHASE: Vernon will publish and disseminate the Erasmus+ call, so as to receive applications from teachers, administrative and management staff, and arouse curiosity among all potential participants.\r\nPREPARATION PHASE: Cesur and Vernon will discuss the details of the programme. PractiGo will research which possibilities there are to accommodate Vernon teachers and staff in Malaga. Finally, Vernon will organise an information meeting prior to mobility to give some clues to the teachers and staff involved about language, culture, weather and environment of the host training centre in Spain, Cesur.\r\nMOBILITY PERIOD: The main topics of the training event organised by Cesur in Malaga will be: the Spanish educational system, how to deal with foreign students and show empathy, Spanish culture, IT and Food, IT and employability, customer service and European-orientated further training.\r\nFINAL PHASE: Vernon will organise the final workshop, where participants will exchange their experiences abroad, gather acquired competences and analyse how they can be applied at work in the college, analyse the learning process followed abroad, share proposals for improvement for next potential mobility projects and share opinions and plan how Vernon is going to participate at European level in the near future.\r\n\r\nWe expect a great project impact at all levels.

An effortless access to online information, socialisation, and media is constant, highly promoting an internationalised mainstream culture. This ever-evolving access to quick and easy information and social media culture, is reducing young people\u2019s connection to their cultural roots, sense of belonging and social capitol.\r\n\r\nIn The Republic of Moldova a strategic political effort and a network of local 'cultural houses' in all villages has successfully promoted and preserved the local traditions among young people. Young people are, on a large scale, engaging in traditional dance, handcrafts or music. In the local discos, between American mainstream music, you will still find that a traditional dance, the \"hora\" is getting most people on the dance floor. \r\n\r\nBy exploring this sense of cultural belonging in Moldova, the project partners intend to reflect on cultural heritage, and how the participation of youth in their own community and culture can be increased.\r\n\r\n Furthermore, the project is looking to build upon the experiences, share practices from partners and stakeholders, and develop common local and international strategies and methods for inventively promoting cultural heritage among youth in the EU.\r\n\r\nIn line with this, the project  aim is to promote cultural heritage among youth through innovative and artistic activities delivered by youth workers and youth organisations. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet this aim, the following objectives have been identified:\r\n1) Give  youth workers from 8 programme and partner countries examples of best practice of how to preserve and promote local heritage through artistic activities \r\n2) Make youth workers from 8 programme and partner countries reflect on the importance of cultural heritage in ensuring social capital and participation amongst youth\r\n3) Explore youth work practices in combining mainstream and traditional culture through art and entrepreneurship\r\n4) Create artistic methods aiming at preserving and promoting cultural heritage among young people, with inputs from practices across 8 partner and programme countries\r\n5) Develop concrete strategies and common policies for promoting cultural heritage among young people with inputs from practices across 8 partner and programme countries\r\n6) Strengthen  and internationalise youth workers and youth organisations professional networks\r\n7) Create visibility, dissemination, and local impact through the project for promoting local heritage amongst youth in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe methods, strategies and policies developed through the project to promote cultural heritage amongst youth will be adopted and implemented within the overall strategies and policies of the partner organisations, ensuring the project results are followed up and exploited.

Its objective is to identify ways to improve the education and inclusion of these students, to strengthen their skills in the language of the host country, to allow access to culture and facilitate employment, to better train teachers of French as a Second Language (FSL) and all teachers who participate in the inclusion of these students in regular curricula. \r\n \r\nThe consortium counts 24 members and cooperates with 13 international host institutions. Different profiles of staff are concerned by the inclusion of migrant pupils and students not speaking the language of the host country, and participate in the project: teachers involved in UPE2A \u2013 classes meant for newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, regular class teachers, senior management teams of schools and executives of the local education authority of Strasbourg, inspectors and pedagogical counsellors, \r\nproject managers of different departments of the local education authority of Strasbourg. \r\n \r\nThe welcoming and training practices in Alsace are managed by the CASNAV - academic centre for the schooling of newly arrived students and students from traveling families - and can be enriched according to each situation - initiation, improvement, enhancement, broadening, diversification) by the expertise of our European partners and the devices they have put in place.\r\n \r\nThis is why the local education authority of Strasbourg has decided to set up a consortium to apply for an Erasmus + mobility project, in accordance with European values and its regional educational priorities: inclusion in schools, social integration, equal opportunities, diversity and gender equality, employability of youngsters, fighting against school dropout and radicalization.\r\n \r\nThe host organizations were selected according to the following criteria:\r\n- diversity of their experiences in the field of welcoming migrants, refugees, asylum seekers not speaking the languages of the host countries, \r\n- situations in countries which are first faced with massive waves of migrants;\r\n- quality of the historical cooperation that binds them to the local education authority of Strasbourg\r\nTaking into account the destinations of the mobility and therefore the choice of the host partner for each delegation, the steering committee considered it relevant to take into account the matching with the teaching cycle, the level and the specialization of the participants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will make it possible to carry out 128 mobility for the staff of the whole education authority of Strasbourg according to 3 strategic levels:\r\n- level of institutional steering;\r\n- level of management of schools;\r\n- school level of EANA - newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers not speaking the language of the host country.\r\n \r\nThe activities will consist in work-shadowing lessons, shared teaching and exchanging of best practices, meetings with local, institutional or non-profit organization partners. They will cover the practical aspects of hosting migrants, teaching, methods and material, also the transmission of European values and access to culture and to different forms of artistic expression that are the roots of social cohesion and democracy as well as the education to citizenship.\r\n \r\nThe result of the mobility project will fuel an analysis and a reflection on transferable practices in our local education authority of Strasbourg. \r\n \r\nThe eTwinning platform will be the tool of choice for the organization and communication of the project. This platform will serve as a means of exchanging, sharing and disseminating the results.\r\n \r\nThe expected impacts are at three levels:\r\n - academic steering and institutional management of welcoming migrants, refugees and asylum seekers not speaking the language of the host country, \r\n- the management of schools in terms of welcoming strategy;\r\n- support of newly arrived pupils and students who have newly arrived in the class and their inclusion in the regular curricula.\r\n\r\nThe transferable practices that we have observed during the mobility will make it possible to improve the education of newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers and their inclusion in the regular curricula to allow a fluent schooling and follow up of the newcomers in regular classes. To put it in a nutshell, all pupils and students with special needs will benefit from the results. \r\nGiven the current political and climatic trends, it is highly likely that the migration phenomenon towards Europe will keep increasing in the forthcoming years.
