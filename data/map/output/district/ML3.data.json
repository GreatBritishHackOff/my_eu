The INSPIRE Implementing Rules Legal Acts outlines these data pools, but more work is needed.Making data available according to the INSPIRE standards in 30 countries using 22 languages requires specific skill sets that few public authorities have. The management of this content represents an opportunity for SMEs active in this sector.SMEs can enable countries to fulfil the Directive, creating new market opportunities with increased potential for innovation and new jobs. Due to the legal requirements, the INSPIRE implementation becomes the entry-point for crucial business opportunities, opening new, or reinforcing existing perspectives (including Linked Open Data, Sensor Web, cloud computing and other e-environment application domains).SmeSpire's purpose is to encourage and enable the participation of SMEs in the mechanisms of harmonising and making large scale environmental content available. smeSpire will:1. assess market potential for SMEs in relation to INSPIRE as an integral component of the Digital Agenda for Europe, describing obstacles for SMEs to enter this market in terms of knowledge gaps2. collate, translate and exploit a Best Practice Catalogue in the management of environmental content3. Develop a multilingual package to train environmental data analysts in the maintenance and exploitation of environmental data commons, and4. create a network capable of transferring result-driven knowledge throughout Europe with research centres, environmental agencies, progressive technology providers and digital content providers.smeSpire offers the Commission an early integration of results for relevant programmes (ISA) directly into the knowledge base of geo-ICT SMEs", 137402.0, 1640095.0, "smeSpire", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_103999_969219927"], ["8PX", "Ubiquitous iNteroperable Care for Ageing People", "GiStandards LTD", "The lack of ICT platforms based on open standards is regarded as one of the most significant market barriers to the creation of new care & assistance paradigms with global interconnection and interworking. UNCAP delivers an interoperable platform based on open industrial standards that leverages on existing technologies for biosensing, indoor/outdoor localisation and home-automation. The result is an open source, scalable and privacy-savvy ecosystem compatible with existing Personal Health Record systems, that can deliver novel services that can help aging people (incl. those with cognitive impairments) live independently and with dignity. \nTo do so, UNCAP uses state-of-art physical/cognitive assessment tools together with technologies to locate objects, devices and users within indoor/outdoor spaces, to continuously monitor\u2013in a non-invasive way- users and to assist them in case alert conditions are detected. \nIn practice, UNCAP develops a product suite for formal and informal care environments made of: 1) the UNCAP BOX (an Android consumer device connected to TVs); 2) the UNCAP App for both users and caregivers; 3) the UNCAP CLOUD, delivering scalable care services; 4) the UNCAP certification suite, to help software and hardware manufacturers assess compliancy with standards.\nUNCAP will be assessed for 12 months in 14 pilots within real operational scenarios. \nPilots will be located in rehabilitation centres, daily nursing facilities etc. and will involve 750\\ users and 220 caregivers. Users\u2019 physical & cognitive assessment will be carried on before and after the introduction of UNCAP to extract quantifiable metrics to assess its impact in terms of quality of care services and improved quality of life of users and caregivers.\nLastly, UNCA will carry on a RoI analysis (both financial & social), an analysis of best practices of innovative organisational/business models as well as financing/procurement models for health & care service delivery at EU level.", 88696.0, 3070146.0, "UNCAP", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_196618_969219927"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["6LB", "South Lanarkshire Poverty and Inclusion", "South Lanarkshire Council", "To provide financial support, fuel and energy advice, household budgeting advice and support access to employability services to homeless households.", "ESF", 250949.0, 627372.5, "esf_scotland_147"], ["6LB", "South Lanarkshire Management and Compliance", "South Lanarkshire Council", "Strategic Intervention management, administration and compliance.", "ESF", 260130.0, 650325.0, "esf_scotland_206"], ["6LB", "SLC Employability Pipeline", "South Lanarkshire Council", "The Operation will work with participants with multiple barriers.
