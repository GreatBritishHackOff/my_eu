Therefore, soil contamination is an increasing worldwide problem, which poses severe threats to ecosystem and human health. Through the EU, thousands of sites have been contaminated by previous industrial use, former military sites and other sources of pollution. Despite of different cleaning measures applied, area of contaminated land is constantly increasing as a result of almost all sort of human activities as well as inadequate practices and accidents. The European Commission has acknowledged that soil pollution in the EU is a major issue and currently soil remediation is one of the top priorities of EU environment policy.\nThe successfully implemented SORBENT project (Soil remediation technique for in situ cleaning of soils contaminated with heavy hydrocarbon mixtures, GA No 232533 financed from FP7-SME-2008-1 call) had led to the development of SORBENT integrated technique consisting of 3 individual components (SORBENT system, SORBENT bacterial preparation and phyto-remediation) each based on different remediation solution which has already proved it\u2019s applicability to all types of oil in different soil profiles and convenient use. It is significantly faster, more efficient and up to 25% reduces the overall soil remediation costs.\nDespite the many advantages the wide market application is hampered by two main market barriers: insufficient demonstration and verification of the application of novel technique in real life projects and limitations of current polices: the demonstration is needed to ensure documentations and to gin regulatory acceptance of the novel technique. Thus the SORBENT-DEMO project is proposed with the overall objective to carry out the targeted full-scale demonstration of the novel SORBENT technique and to develop the framework to get regulatory acceptance for its use.", 173801.0, 1443429.0, "SORBENT-DEMO", null, null, null, "http://sorbent.lt/", "http://www.wildberryenterprises.com", null, "fp7_185467_950065725"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7DB", "\u00d8kt motivasjon og l\u00e6ringsutbytte for alle elevene p\u00e5 Riska ungdomsskole gjennom kollektiv kompetanseheving for l\u00e6rerne innen realfag, pedagogisk bruk av iPad, Lesson Study og god vurderingspraksis.", "Hayes School (Bromley)", 20148.0, "Riska Ungdomsskole is a secondary school located at Riska in the municipality of Sandnes, Norway. The socioeconomic conditions in this area is below average for Sandnes. The school has about 300 learners and a staff of 38. The school rated above medium in the national \u201cAdded value\u201d index, published for the first time January 2017. Our learning result measured by exams and national tests scores below the results for Sandnes. Our learners report that they are satisfied with the learning environment and the welfare at school. The local school authorities have through several years focused on developing sustainable schools, offering adequate education for every learner, regardless of their own socio-economic background and special needs. Preparing learners to help them succeed in completing secondary school is a paramount object in Norway, like in the rest of Europe. Late 2015 our school fulfilled our participation in a national initiated project aiming to make the lower secondary school more varied, challenging, practical and relevant for the learners. All this to motivate the learners and to make them believe in their own abilities to complete Secondary school. Riska Ungdomsskole initiated a strategy containing four main objectives to pursue this work and to increase the learning outcome for all of our students. Our school implemented iPads for all students and staff late 2015 to develop the student\u2019s technological abilities and to educate our students in internet security, internet ethics and internet safety. Managing technology is crucial in a world being more and more digitalized. A second objective was to increase the student motivation and the production of student works. The technology opened for new ways for students to share their work and efficient ways to assess student work. Early 2016 the school started using Lesson Study as a model of teacher collaboration and professional development. The objective was also to learn more about the student response to the teaching they were offered. Our strategy also contains a revitalization of our work related to assessment for learning. We aim to update our staff on several aspects concerning assessment for learning, but put the most effort into how to involve students in the assessment of their own products. National education authorities have challenged schools in Sandnes to have a special focus on science education. Due to this, we aim to update the teachers in our science department accordingly, so they can offer our students an education suitable for the 21th century. Our project aims to strengthen all these four areas of development.  We want to build international relations to bring new knowledge and new methods back to our school, to make our plans and actions more sustainable and according to international research and best practice. Key staff to work with the management leading the processes. All the school leaders play a central part in this work. We acknowledge that great schools are developing their skills together, and that their school leaders are deeply involved in this work. During the project we intend to send all of our teachers to visit at least one partner abroad. We have planned for 55 visits. The visits will be planned based on what subjects they teach, which grade they teach and their experience. They will have a learning assignment, and when they come back, they will share their learning with the project group and their colleagues. New knowledge will be implemented and new experience and knowledge will be shared with other schools. We will visit schools that have proved good practice within each of the areas of development. Academic environments in Norway and in the host countries have recommended schools to visit. Our teachers will attend lessons and watch how the use of iPads enhance learning in the context of the partner school. Following the observation, our teachers will take part in reflection groups together with staff from host schools. Teachers visiting schools focusing on Lesson Study, will attend the planning, observe the teaching and take part in the reflections after a Lesson Study cycle. Staff visiting schools to study assessment for learning, will observe how teachers work and take part in discussions related to this topic. They will be focusing on to learn about how to let students take part in assessment in a way that is moving them forward in their learning. Staff teaching science subjects will take part in courses and conferences relevant to our objectives. The expected short-term effect of this project is an increase in the score on reported motivation and student involvement in assessment, measured through the national student survey. We also expect students to report they experience more support from their teacher in their learning. We expect the long-term effects to reflect in higher scores on both exams and national tests. Finally, this should result in less students dropping out of secondary school.", "http://www.hayes.bromley.sch.uk/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NO01-KA101-034028_5"], ["8HE", "Mobilit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne des lyc\u00e9es professionnels de Lorraine", "Bromley College of Further & Higher Education", 743659.0, "This ERASMUS + mobility consortium for VET students in Lorraine, also known as MELYPROLOR 6 (in French, consortium de Mobilit\u00e9 pour les LYc\u00e9ens en formation PROfessionnelle en LORraine), is in line with group projects of the previous programme LEONARDO or ERASMUS+ KA1. It is brought by the DAREIC (D\u00e9l\u00e9gation Acad\u00e9mique aux relations Europ\u00e9ennes, Internationales et \u00e0 la Coop\u00e9ration) and the GIP (Groupement d'Int\u00e9r\u00eat Public) \"Formation tout au long de la vie\" of the acad\u00e9mie de Nancy-Metz (Nancy-Metz Education Authority). A steering group (with members of the DAREIC and the GIP as well as 2 representatives of 2 schools that are members of the 6th consortium and the former group projects) will deal with devising, following and managing the projet. The person in charge of projects as well as the administratitve assistant at the DAREIC (whose mission is to favour the European and international mobility of students in the acad\u00e9mie) will be the permanent link between the mobility management committees in every school of the consortium. The project meets the goals and priorities of ERASMUS + in the field of vocational education and training \u2013 that is to say enabling the greatest number of students to take part in a quality European mobility and enhancing the cooperation between vocational schools and companies via the mobilities of school staff members. \r\nMELYPROLOR 6 brings together 33 vocational, comprehensive and trades schools of the acad\u00e9mie. 26 of them already took part in one of the previous projects, which highlights the interest that these schools have found in this opportunity to join a group European project. \r\nIt will permit traineeship abroad mobilities for 472 students of Premi\u00e8re or Terminale (Year 12 or 13) over a period of 12, 26, 33 or 56 days, for 180 accompagnying members of staff, as well as 56 teachers in staff training over a period of 5 or 7 days. The different mobilities will concern 12 European countries, over a period of 2 years. Tool sharing is already carried out via the collaborative platform open to all the members of the consortium. It has improved over the different group projects and from this year, it offers new tools such as a form with the names of companies ready to answer the requests of new schools (either in the same domain or in additional domains) or a European citizenship questionnaire taken before and after the mobility. The mobilities are envisaged in 41 domains, from the restaurant industry to the art embroidery including the stone trades or the maintenance of industrial equipments.\r\nWhatever their course, the students of the technology and vocational schools often form a weakened public, not very prone to move, which is particularly the case in Lorraine (as the figures show). Thanks to the European mobility, they will develop their professional skills in a different setting as well as their language skills. They will also acquire autonomy, self-confidence, capacity for adaptation to constraints and new working methods \u2013 some qualities that will make their insertion in the working world easier, be it in France, in one of the 3 border countries or elsewhere. Beyond the accompanying staff,  often necessary at the beginning and/or at the end of the mobility (since the students are still minors), the opportunity to include training mobilities for the school staff in this project gives these people the possibility to integrate in the receiving companies, to develop a partnership over time, to assess everyone\u2019s expectations, to negociate the training contents at best, and for some of them to register for the certification in the teaching of a subject in a foreign language (CLIL lessons).", "http://www.bromley.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-035387_6"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BR2"}
