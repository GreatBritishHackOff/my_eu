Therefore, soil contamination is an increasing worldwide problem, which poses severe threats to ecosystem and human health. Through the EU, thousands of sites have been contaminated by previous industrial use, former military sites and other sources of pollution. Despite of different cleaning measures applied, area of contaminated land is constantly increasing as a result of almost all sort of human activities as well as inadequate practices and accidents. The European Commission has acknowledged that soil pollution in the EU is a major issue and currently soil remediation is one of the top priorities of EU environment policy.\nThe successfully implemented SORBENT project (Soil remediation technique for in situ cleaning of soils contaminated with heavy hydrocarbon mixtures, GA No 232533 financed from FP7-SME-2008-1 call) had led to the development of SORBENT integrated technique consisting of 3 individual components (SORBENT system, SORBENT bacterial preparation and phyto-remediation) each based on different remediation solution which has already proved it\u2019s applicability to all types of oil in different soil profiles and convenient use. It is significantly faster, more efficient and up to 25% reduces the overall soil remediation costs.\nDespite the many advantages the wide market application is hampered by two main market barriers: insufficient demonstration and verification of the application of novel technique in real life projects and limitations of current polices: the demonstration is needed to ensure documentations and to gin regulatory acceptance of the novel technique. Thus the SORBENT-DEMO project is proposed with the overall objective to carry out the targeted full-scale demonstration of the novel SORBENT technique and to develop the framework to get regulatory acceptance for its use.", 173801.0, 1443429.0, "SORBENT-DEMO", null, null, null, "http://sorbent.lt/", "http://www.wildberryenterprises.com", null, "fp7_185467_950065725"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BR2"}
