Unlike other approaches to monitoring complex structures, guided wave technology provides large area coverage from a limited number of sensors.\n\nHowever, aircraft structures as well as the environment in which they interact are complex. Detecting defects from the plethora of geometric data collected using guided ultrasonic waves is therefore an incredibly challenging task.

Moreover, sport reflects on different values and can create a bridge between different social groups forming better mutual understanding. The answer could be reaffirmed by quoting United Nations, which \u201crecognize that sport, as a tool for education, development and peace, can promote cooperation, solidarity, tolerance, understanding, social inclusion and health at the local, national and international levels\u201d. We will start all days with morning sports, most of non-formal education methods will be done in outdoors and we will do hiking (sometimes over the night), running and mountain hiking.\r\n\r\nAnother question could be: why hiking, running and mountain hiking and why Wales, Northen Ireland and Scotland?\r\nFirst of all, hiking is a big individual and group challenge, when instincts of self-preservation disappears. It becomes easier to analyze sensitive topics, people do not hide under the masks, therefore, better results could be reached. Youth also learn faster in such environment. Running is inspired from a book \u201eBorn To Run: A Hidden Tribe, the Ultra-Runners, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen\u201d, written by Christopher McDougall, where author analyses human roots and essential capacity to run long distances. Lastly, mountain hiking is a kind of outdoor meditation that youth need to discover as soon as possible, so that it could later serve as a medium/method to restore the balance after urban challenges.\r\n\r\nSecond, we do directly relate it with current situation whereas a lot of refugees had to walk or run over mountains, cross the sea and borders to reach peace in Europe. We will do similar thing in order to step in their shoes (and thus comes the name of the YE) for a while. We believe that this correlation will help us to reach even better results and will help to start thinking about the current situation.\r\n\r\nThird, the concept \u201eStep In Their Shoes\u201d attempts to search connecting points from (1) a regional perspective, thus implementing three youth exchanges in different UK regions, (2) value perspective - we will combine sports and hiking with special methods, where we will analyse own behaviour and important values particularly related to our topic: \r\nKnowledge\r\nInvolvement\r\nNature\r\nGrowth\r\n\r\nWe are combining every days active lifestyle with non- formal education methods in youth work. The specific objectives of this project:\r\n(1) To reach personal development which helps to understand ourselves and reflect on own behavior and behavior of others;\r\n(2) Challenge the perception of the structures within our society that undermine social inclusion or foster discrimination;\r\n(3) Overcoming the stereotypes of different religions;\r\n(4) To raise awareness on the topic of discrimination;\r\n(5) To build a broader understanding of what an inclusive attitude means and to start inter cultural and inter- religious dialogue;\r\n(6) To understand the connections between culture and sport and to understand the inter cultural aspects of sport;\r\n(7) To raise the sense of empathy towards other people.\r\n\r\nProject consists of 1 APV and 3 youth exchanges to be held in Wales (13-22 March 2018), Northern Ireland (24 April \u2013 3 May 2018) and Scotland (31 July \u2013 9 August). The APV will be held in Wales from 6 to 8 February 2018.

Present youth is the first E-Generation, which grew up in the environment of computers, i-pods, Internet, Facebook, playstations and can stay in front of the computer for 12 hours in a row. This generation avoids going out and having fun with simple things like hiking and camping in the nature. With this project we would like to bring them outdoor, give a chance to discover different \"world\" - nature. With this project we are seeking to address the importance of spending time outdoors: exploring the nature, to show that spending time and learning outdoors is a great way to keep fit both mentally and physically. \r\n\r\nBased on long standing scouting experience, we designed a unique programme of outdoor experiential learning that enables and increases personal (me), social (we) and environmental (all) interactions, exchange of experiences and understanding among people of various backgrounds, nationalities or beliefs, beyond cultural and traditional barriers. This programme also promotes cultural diversity by involving European and non European participants.\r\n\r\nProject \u201cEast or West \u2013 Outdoors is the Best\u201d is a multilateral 2 phased youth exchange project aimed to promote healthy behaviours, in particular through promotion of sports and outdoor activities as a mean to reach a healthy lifestyle. \r\n\r\nProgramme has following objectives:\r\n- To explain the main principles of outdoor education and using experience as learning tool with the main focus on outdoor activities;\r\n- Through the own experience to increase motivation of participants and their involvement in organizing activities in the nature;\r\n- Promote healthy life style and sport activities;\r\n- To experience camping and living outdoors;\r\n- To increase multicultural competences among participants and strengthen relationship between partner organisations and youth from partner organisation network;\r\n- To increase the competences of partner organisations in using outdoor education to apply in youth work and capacity to cooperate for future projects.\r\n\r\nThe project East of West \u2013 Outdoors is the Best is a two phased YE project:\r\n- East #1: Pona Village, Lagodekhi Region in Georgia, 29 May - 6 June 2018\r\n- West #2: Isle of Skye, Scotland, 3 - 11 July 2018 \r\n\r\nBoth youth exchanges will involve in total 7 countries: four E+ programme countries (UK, Italy, Poland and Portugal) and three Eastern partnership countries (Georgia, Ukraine, Armenia).

The coordinator of the project Subtiluship CIC is a non profit social enterprise with background in outdoors, media, social entrepreneurship, sustainable development, healthy lifestyles and personal development.\r\n\r\nIt is a project that unites a total of 96 participants from 6 European countries: UK, Romania, Greece, Lithuania, Poland and Croatia in 3 youth exchanges across 2018, all taking place in London, UK. The theme \u201cHow to live healthy, active and fresh\u201d comprises of 3 main topics: healthy food, active outdoor physical activity and self-leadership. Each exchange focus on one of these topics, reshaping approaches and behaviors of young people and subsequently improving their inner ecosystem.  \r\n\r\nThe methods used are practical and hands-on, with direct inputs and outputs from participants themselves - starting each morning with physical activities, having each meal health-oriented and working on personal development on a daily basis. This approach is designed to give a momentum to the lives of young people, leading to sustainable incremental changes. We believe the healthier the life is, the more productive and fruitful results can be, enriching employability & entrepreneurship potential and performance.\r\n\r\nThe project consists of the three phases in one location and 2 months phase after each exchange in 6 different countries:\r\n#HealthyHabits #1 \u20137 days - 8-16 May 2018\r\n#HealthyHabits #2  \u2013 7 days - 19-27 June 2018\r\n#HealthyHabits #3 \u2013 7 days \u2013 21-29 August 2018\r\n#HealthyHabits #Follow-up of 2 month after each exchange \r\n\r\nThe follow up is an integration phase of 2 months after each exchange, in which participants take charge of their own lives and implement personal healthy campaigns, with online posts that eventually results in awareness among friend network.\r\n\r\nWe expect:\r\n- 20-40% increase in knowledge about healthy food, diets, preparing food;\r\n- 30-40% more active youth on the fields of outdoor and sports;\r\n- 96 participants with a plan - vision, objectives, values on what they want to change in their lifes;\r\n- 20-40% rate of implementation of the integration plan;\r\n- 10-12 NGOs where participants can implement their follow-up;\r\n- over 800/participant reach on Facebook after the healthy campaign;\r\n- over 12 tools contributed by participants to the workbook of healthy lifestyle.", "http://abroadship.org", "Subtiluship C.I.C.", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA105-046395_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "UB6"}
