Now, an EU-funded project has developed a technique combining guided ultrasound wave technology and neural network systems to monitor the health of buried aircraft components.", "Aircraft are large and complex machines, yet even the tiniest crack in the remotest or hardest-to-reach corner can have major consequences in terms of safety and flight worthiness. This makes periodic inspection and maintenance not only vital, but also laborious and time consuming as certain components are concealed beneath layers of other components.\n\nThe 'Neural net based defect detection system using LRU technology for aircraft structure monitoring' (http://www.selfscanproject.eu/ (SELF-SCAN)) project developed a technique using guided wave technology to make inspections and maintenance more efficient while enhancing safety. Unlike other approaches to monitoring complex structures, guided wave technology provides large area coverage from a limited number of sensors.\n\nHowever, aircraft structures as well as the environment in which they interact are complex. Detecting defects from the plethora of geometric data collected using guided ultrasonic waves is therefore an incredibly challenging task. Financed by the EU's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), SELF-SCAN came up with the novel idea of using neural network systems using permanently installed sensors to enable in situ detection.\n\nWith a consortium drawn from six EU Member States, the project team created an advanced integrated system for structural health monitoring and impending failure detection. The prototype system demonstrated its ability to differentiate between sound and defective components, as well as to detect minute but critical cracks in regions considered inaccessible to other sensors.\n\nOnce developed further into a commercialised system, ultrasound detection will help bolster safety, lower the risk of catastrophic failure, reduce costs and increase the service life of aircraft components.", "http://www.selfscanproject.eu", null, "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58256.jpg", "fp7_93489_999739716"], ["8UA", "In-situ wireless monitoring of on- and offshore WINd TURbine blades using energy harvesting technology", "Ultra Electronics Limited", "This project will develop an integrated system to monitor continuously the condition of wind turbine blades, without human intervention on site, using a novel integration of acoustic emission (AE) and long range ultrasonics (LRU).

Among the main topics to be addressed for the advanced air interface are new MIMO schemes offering higher diversity and multiplexing gains as well as interference cancellation capabilities, advanced synchronization and channel estimation techniques that are compatible with the increased mobility requirement, advanced radio resource allocation schemes involving cross-layer optimisation, as well as cooperation between users and base stations. Research results developed within the framework of this STREP will be used to draft contributions to the IEEE 802.16m working group and influence this future standard. The developed concepts and algorithms will be simulated, prototyped and then integrated into SoCs to be developed by SEQUANS Communications and tested by other industrial partners of the consortium. The implementation plan for the project is based on a hypothetical system called WiMAGIC that embodies a beyond the state of the art (SoA) target BWA system. WiMAGIC serves as a conceptual platform for 1) specifying target system requirements, 2) developing sub-system level beyond the SoA technological solutions, 3) integrating the sub-system solutions for end-to-end simulation, testing and validation of the WiMAGIC design.
