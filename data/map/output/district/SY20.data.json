Concentrating initially on the Welsh Dyfi Biosphere Reserve, we will develop a citizens\u2019 observatory framework, and then validate the work within the context of the UK National Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) and internationally, within the WNBR; specifically, within Greek and German Reserves. The infrastructure we develop will exploit technological developments in ubiquitous mobile devices, crowd-sourcing of geographic information and the operationalising of standards based SDI such as the UK Location Information Infrastructure. It will enable citizens living within Biosphere Reserves to collect environmental information on a range of parameters including species distribution, flooding and land cover/use. A main driver will be the opportunity to participate in environmental governance. Data quality issues will be addressed by using networks of \u201cpeople as sensors\u201d and by analysing observations and measurements in real-time combination with authoritative models and datasets. The citizen\u2019s observatory framework will integrate with evolving INSPIRE compliant national SDI\u2019s and allow the fusion of citizen sourced data with reference data from public authorities in support of policy objectives. To maximise impact, COBWEB will work within the processes of the standards defining organisations. Specifically, we will aim to improve the usability of Sensor Web Enablement standards with mobile devices, develop widespread acceptance of the data quality measures we develop and maximise the commercial appeal of COBWEB outputs. The end result we are aiming for is a toolkit and a set of models that demonstrably works in different European countries and which is accepted as a core information system component of the WNBR.  Implementations of COBWEB will act as models for how technology may be used to empower citizens associations in environmental decision making.", 75581.0, 6795427.0, "COBWEB", "Apps aiding environmental study", "An EU study aims to utilise citizens and their mobile devices to collect reliable environmental data. Using techniques for crowdsourcing geographic information, the initial focus is species distribution, flooding and land cover of a Welsh reserve.", "Environmental research usually involves small groups doing a great deal of field and laboratory work over long periods; progress is labour intensive and slow. One way to improve matters is by utilising local residents as sources of data.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Citizen observatory web' (http://cobwebproject.eu (COBWEB)) aims to develop a citizens' observatory framework. The concept means enabling residents and users of biosphere reserves to collect environmental data using mobile devices. Based on techniques involving crowdsourcing geographic information, the framework will enable residents to collect data relevant to species distribution, flooding and land cover/use.\n\nProject research also addresses the known reliability issues surrounding citizen-supplied data, and will allow such data to be fused with more reliable sources. The framework initially focuses on Wales' Dyfi Biosphere Reserve, to be validated in other reserves in Germany and Greece. The project's 14 members came together in November 2012, with work slated to run until October 2016.\n\nThe first 18 months first saw stakeholder consultation and definition of user requirements. The project conducted a prototype design activity involving interested parties, and created a pilot Access Management Federation in conjunction with several Group on Earth Observations (GEO) members.\n\nRequirements collated so far are guiding development of the technical architecture, plus demonstrators in three initial areas: biological monitoring, flooding and validation of satellite data. Prototypes covering the first two are mature, and requirements for the third have been defined. A further prototype has been developed, demonstrating how the project's portals may work with its version of GeoNetwork.\n\nWork to date has progressed understanding of methodologies for utilising sensors in environments of limited connectivity, and of how robust and crowdsourced data may be combined.\n\nFollowing field testing in 2014 and 2015, the project issued calls for ideas from groups able to mobilise citizens in the Dyfi Biosphere Reserve. Such proposals will guide upcoming research phases, leading to full demonstration in 2015.\n\nThe COBWEB project will yield open-source software tools able to support multiple citizen observatory scenarios.

Part of this concept is to initiate the development towards an innovative, resource efficient and bio-based (bio-economy) European economy. Such development should contribute to economic growth and the creation of jobs, while mitigating climate change effects and providing effective responses to address the need for carbon neutral energy. In this context, European forests and the forest-based sector play an increasingly important role in fostering smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe based on the production of eco-services and eco-efficient products from wood and non-wood-based products. Up to now the forest-based sector has been mainly build around wood based products. However, also multipurpose trees and non-wood forest products and services can significantly contribute to the achievement of the set goals. The objective of the STAR TREE project is to provide better understanding, knowledge, guidance and tools to support relevant stakeholders (e.g., forest owners, resource managers, enterprises, decision makers, other public and private entities) in optimising the management of multi-purpose trees and developing innovative approaches for increasing the marketability and profitability of NWFP for a more competitive rural economy. The overall impacts of the project are in the long term to support a sustainable rural development through a stronger utilisation of business opportunities based on non-wood forest products and multipurpose trees.

In addition to researching potential markets, they are establishing partnerships between research organisations and small and medium-sized enterprises to develop innovative new products, processes and successful marketing strategies to increase their competitiveness.\n\nBy evaluating regional case studies, consulting with foresters and engaging with stakeholders to understand their needs, STAR TREE aims to streamline the research-to-market forestry value chain. Their guidelines for managing forest trees and providing wood and NWFPs in a range of European environments are informed by models, and are complemented by support material on NWFP markets, regional policies, and innovation strategies.\n\nDiversifying the traditional forestry industry to include both wood and non-wood products will aid the EU objective of basing its economy on sustainable, resource-efficient growth.
