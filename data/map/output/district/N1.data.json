However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.  It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.  HTA bodies, regulators, will become able to make better-informed decisions, and developers of new medicines will be able to direct development efforts to areas where value is most likely to be delivered to patients and health care systems, improving the efficiency of the whole medicine development chain. \nHowever, the adoption of real world / relative effectiveness objectives in a pre-authorisation development strategy has many operational, methodological, regulatory, and ethical issues and Pharmaceutical R&D organisations need more certainty as to: the impact of development choices on the regulatory review process; the value of different programmes to HTA bodies and other decision makers; the best balance of pre-launch and post-launch effectiveness research and the coordination of various post-authorisation commitments.

This transition requires adoption of novel reactor technologies, greener reactions and the increase in the use of intelligent systems in processing industries. The latter means improving processes through use of real-time information and ability to affect processes in real time. The long-term vision of COOPOL is to develop new methods and tools for modeling and control, based on real-time sensing, which will facilitate the development of a new paradigm of processes: intensive, low-impact, sustainable chemical technologies. The COOPOL consortium is focusing on one of the key areas of interest to European Chemical Industries, namely the polymer industry. Within the chemicals sector polymer production plays a significant role, with European market share of 25% and providing employment to 1.6 million people within EU27.\nMany polymer products are manufactured using batch and semi-batch reactors. In most cases the process parameters, such as temperature profile, feeds, etc follow a specific time schedule, which has been fixed after an expensive period of product and process development. This tight recipe schedule is sensitive against disturbances e.g., unexpected variation in operating conditions, variation in feed purity etc., which inevitably leads to variations in polymer structure and\u00a0to inter-batch variability and off-spec products. Furthermore, the use of empirically determined recipes with fixed-time controls does not allow intensification of the process which requires time-varying feeds and reactor temperature to run the reaction faster and hence closer to its limits,  and also to switching from a semi-batch to other reactor or process types.\nCOOPOL addresses the complex issues of real-time process control based on advanced models and on-line sensors, to develop a generic basis for widely applicable sustainable intensified processes. COOPOL will develop a new process control approach, linking molecular level information and understanding of the reaction chemistry with real-time sensing, rigorous modeling based on first principles, subsequent model reduction and non-linear model-predictive control (NMPC) with economic objectives, called dynamic real-time optimisation (DRTO).

Through the analysis of current food chains in urbanised areas, the 'Food planning and innovation for sustainable metropolitan regions' (http://www.foodmetres.eu/ (FOODMETRES)) project will create and improve the sustainability of the urban food production chain. This includes not only reducing food metres or the length of food chains, but also increasing recycling and improving the efficiency of production technology.\n\nDuring the first phase of the project, the consortium established a conceptual framework, establishing links between the innovation targets, scenario development and impact assessment. At the innovation workshop in Wageningen, the project-specific concept 'system innovation' was developed, comprised of product, process, social and governance domains. Three spatial\u2013functional layers of agro-food systems, including LAS (local), MAS (metropolitan) and GAS (global) were also specified, and a set of candidate indicators reviewed.\n\nThe team has performed an assessment on MAS areas in terms of supply capacity and the land use areas of metropolitan centres. Furthermore, a Common Operational Data Protocol (CODP) was established for the case study research and a http://data.foodmetres.eu (FOODMETRES data repository) was uploaded on to a MediaFire site.\n\nTwo distinct analytical strands for the assessment of Metropolitan 'foodprint' and sustainability impacts for different chain types were also established and implemented. The first strand involves a generic qualitative benchmarking procedure for sustainability impact assessment making use of food-specific Impact Areas and a newly developed Food Chain Typology. The second strand offers a spatially explicit approach for land-use allocation to match the consumer demands at the regional level.

They provided information regarding a disease, availability of patients to enter a clinical trial, review of clinical trial protocols and the informed consent process.\n\nInterviews revealed that patient organisations are essential for providing information on opportunities for patients to get actively involved in clinical trials. The generated PATIENTPARTNER inventory formed the basis for a series of Europe-wide and regional workshops, where the two sides exchanged views on how patient organisations could become partners in clinical research. Although evidence showed that this partnership can be achieved, concerns were raised regarding the potential regional differences in patients' attitudes, interest and level of involvement in clinical research.\n\nThe PATIENTPARTNER dialogue emphasised the need for raising awareness on the importance of patient involvement in clinical research and for training clinical personnel appropriately. An overview of best practices in the involvement of patients in clinical trials was presented. To support this interaction and enable stakeholders to find the right partners, establishing a clinical research database was deemed to be essential.\n\nPATIENTPARTNER underscored the importance of using patients and patient organisations as a paradigm for improving the quality, quantity and effectiveness of clinical research. The need for making connections between patients and stakeholders was addressed through guidance material and policy recommendations.

At the heart of this project is the fundamental belief that working inclusively produces more exciting, more excellent artistic work for audiences.The partnership is formed of the leaders in innovative professional inclusive practice. As organisations working in the mainstream dance world, the partners have demonstrated and been recognised for the importance and quality of inclusive practice. However, opportunities for disabled artists to develop their work and for diverse artists to work together remain limited. There is a lack of training, employment and understanding of inclusive practice within the mainstream sector, and we believe this is restricting the potential growth and health of the cultural arena as audiences dwindle and the arts are increasingly perceived as rarefied and limited. With the aim to firmly address these issues, Moving Beyond Inclusion will provide a groundbreaking continuum from professional training to performance to audiences, ensuring that positive change can be sustained through the showcasing of and opening-up of discussion around the best of inclusive practice. Working across the UK, Croatia, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland, this project will deliver 4 core strands of work:  1) Skills development for creative individuals and administrative teams; 2) The creation of excellent new work for international performance; 3) Comprehensive consideration of building audiences; 4) Series of symposia to support a change in perceptions around dance, disability and quality.The overall project outcomes include: innovation in audience development to communicate more widely the thrill of inclusive work, increased employment, training and mobility for disabled artists, and increased capacity of dance organisations to disseminate inclusive work.", "http://www.candoco.co.uk", "CANDOCO DANCE COMPANY", "creative_570445-CREA-1-2016-1-UK-CULT-COOP1_coordinator"], ["0PB", "We're Going on a Bear Hunt", "BEAR HUNT FILMS LIMITED", 162251.0, "\u2018We\u2019re Going on a Bear Hunt\u2019 is based on the hugely successful illustrated children\u2019s book by Michael Rosen and Helen Oxenbury.  The film, which will be made using hand-drawn animation and hand-painted backgrounds, promises to be a beautifully crafted, timeless classic for a young audience which will prove the jewel in the crown of any holiday TV schedule.  When Grandma\u2019s car breaks down, Mum and Dad go to her rescue, leaving their teenage son Stan in charge of their younger children Katie, Rosie, Max and the baby. Spurred on by Rosie\u2019s love of bears and Dad\u2019s insistence that they go and get some fresh air, the children decide it would be fun to go on a bear hunt. Rufus, the family dog, picks up a scent and leads the children through increasingly challenging countryside, wading through a river, squelching through mud and creeping through a dark forest. Struggling through a snowstorm to a deserted beach, they follow a trail of bear prints that lead them to a narrow gloomy cave. Once inside, Rosie and Rufus become separated from the others and end up in a dark passageway. Switching on her torch Rosie finds herself face to face with a huge bear! Initially frightened, Rosie soon realises that he is just old and lonely and needs looking after. She combs his fur and gives him something to eat. As the appreciative old bear envelops her in a great big hug, the other children suddenly appear. Stan, despite Rosie\u2019s attempts to explain, grabs her and, together with the other children, they run all the way home. Later that evening the parents return home with Grandma, and play along with the children\u2019s story of their bear hunt. As the merriment begins at home, Rosie can\u2019t stop thinking about the bear. She quietly sings a sentimental song, which is carried by the wind to the seashore where the bear stops to listen.

Using new scientific discoveries and never-before-seen visualisations, we take the viewer on a fascinating journey through natural disasters past and present, before exploring future threats. With a strong European focus, we see European scientists and labs, and explore the effect of disasters on European history. Inspired by fresh research pointing to an increase in extreme weather, \u2018Volatile Earth\u2019 is a timely look at our precarious position on the planet. The human race has survived up until now, but when it is man versus nature, who will be the victor? Each of the 3x60 minutes episodes is led by European and international scientists, who toil at the frontlines of our struggle with the climate; it is these inspiring people who have the most compelling stories to tell. They explain the challenges behind their work, taking us with them into the field to see what we are up against. In a race to foresee and survive, these men and women commit themselves to discovering the facts and revealing the prognoses for when and where natural catastrophes will strike next.
