However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.  It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.  HTA bodies, regulators, will become able to make better-informed decisions, and developers of new medicines will be able to direct development efforts to areas where value is most likely to be delivered to patients and health care systems, improving the efficiency of the whole medicine development chain. \nHowever, the adoption of real world / relative effectiveness objectives in a pre-authorisation development strategy has many operational, methodological, regulatory, and ethical issues and Pharmaceutical R&D organisations need more certainty as to: the impact of development choices on the regulatory review process; the value of different programmes to HTA bodies and other decision makers; the best balance of pre-launch and post-launch effectiveness research and the coordination of various post-authorisation commitments.

This transition requires adoption of novel reactor technologies, greener reactions and the increase in the use of intelligent systems in processing industries. The latter means improving processes through use of real-time information and ability to affect processes in real time. The long-term vision of COOPOL is to develop new methods and tools for modeling and control, based on real-time sensing, which will facilitate the development of a new paradigm of processes: intensive, low-impact, sustainable chemical technologies. The COOPOL consortium is focusing on one of the key areas of interest to European Chemical Industries, namely the polymer industry. Within the chemicals sector polymer production plays a significant role, with European market share of 25% and providing employment to 1.6 million people within EU27.\nMany polymer products are manufactured using batch and semi-batch reactors. In most cases the process parameters, such as temperature profile, feeds, etc follow a specific time schedule, which has been fixed after an expensive period of product and process development. This tight recipe schedule is sensitive against disturbances e.g., unexpected variation in operating conditions, variation in feed purity etc., which inevitably leads to variations in polymer structure and\u00a0to inter-batch variability and off-spec products. Furthermore, the use of empirically determined recipes with fixed-time controls does not allow intensification of the process which requires time-varying feeds and reactor temperature to run the reaction faster and hence closer to its limits,  and also to switching from a semi-batch to other reactor or process types.\nCOOPOL addresses the complex issues of real-time process control based on advanced models and on-line sensors, to develop a generic basis for widely applicable sustainable intensified processes. COOPOL will develop a new process control approach, linking molecular level information and understanding of the reaction chemistry with real-time sensing, rigorous modeling based on first principles, subsequent model reduction and non-linear model-predictive control (NMPC) with economic objectives, called dynamic real-time optimisation (DRTO).

Through the analysis of current food chains in urbanised areas, the 'Food planning and innovation for sustainable metropolitan regions' (http://www.foodmetres.eu/ (FOODMETRES)) project will create and improve the sustainability of the urban food production chain. This includes not only reducing food metres or the length of food chains, but also increasing recycling and improving the efficiency of production technology.\n\nDuring the first phase of the project, the consortium established a conceptual framework, establishing links between the innovation targets, scenario development and impact assessment. At the innovation workshop in Wageningen, the project-specific concept 'system innovation' was developed, comprised of product, process, social and governance domains. Three spatial\u2013functional layers of agro-food systems, including LAS (local), MAS (metropolitan) and GAS (global) were also specified, and a set of candidate indicators reviewed.\n\nThe team has performed an assessment on MAS areas in terms of supply capacity and the land use areas of metropolitan centres. Furthermore, a Common Operational Data Protocol (CODP) was established for the case study research and a http://data.foodmetres.eu (FOODMETRES data repository) was uploaded on to a MediaFire site.\n\nTwo distinct analytical strands for the assessment of Metropolitan 'foodprint' and sustainability impacts for different chain types were also established and implemented. The first strand involves a generic qualitative benchmarking procedure for sustainability impact assessment making use of food-specific Impact Areas and a newly developed Food Chain Typology. The second strand offers a spatially explicit approach for land-use allocation to match the consumer demands at the regional level.

They provided information regarding a disease, availability of patients to enter a clinical trial, review of clinical trial protocols and the informed consent process.\n\nInterviews revealed that patient organisations are essential for providing information on opportunities for patients to get actively involved in clinical trials. The generated PATIENTPARTNER inventory formed the basis for a series of Europe-wide and regional workshops, where the two sides exchanged views on how patient organisations could become partners in clinical research. Although evidence showed that this partnership can be achieved, concerns were raised regarding the potential regional differences in patients' attitudes, interest and level of involvement in clinical research.\n\nThe PATIENTPARTNER dialogue emphasised the need for raising awareness on the importance of patient involvement in clinical research and for training clinical personnel appropriately. An overview of best practices in the involvement of patients in clinical trials was presented. To support this interaction and enable stakeholders to find the right partners, establishing a clinical research database was deemed to be essential.\n\nPATIENTPARTNER underscored the importance of using patients and patient organisations as a paradigm for improving the quality, quantity and effectiveness of clinical research. The need for making connections between patients and stakeholders was addressed through guidance material and policy recommendations.

As a result, they are more motivated and  more willing to attend school, to work and ready to make stronger efforts: successful fight against drop-outs.\r\n                          - Personal: This project helps our students to mature, to gain an entrepreneurial spirit and to achieve greater autonomy  which are highly valuable skills demanded by most companies. This program also helps our students to develop a greater sense of acceptance towards people of differing racial, ethnic, generational, sexual and religious backgrounds.\r\n                           - On the labour market: Our students will be employed more easily and they will be more willing to work abroad and to share their skills with other companies.\r\n                         In companies, they are expected to be able to:\r\n                                 - Receive and store goods and perform inventories\r\n                                 - Prepare and ship orders\r\n                                - Welcome drivers on the telephone or in person\r\n                                - Understand written documents.\r\n     \r\n             They will be supervised by the school partners,the project partners (companies and families ), and the members of the CEI.  Meetings, telephone calls, mails, social networks, skype will be used to manage, communicate, cooperate, monitor and assess the mobility program. The students will be accompanied by the English teacher who will make sure the families and companies live up to the  personal and professional expectations (professional tasks in keeping with the school curriculum).

Since 2009, our various LEONARDO mobility activities (Slovakia, Wales, England, Ireland and Poland) have allowed  several  groups of  our students in Catering and electro-technical courses to discover an innovative vocational training  improving their language skills and  expanding their personal experiences. Two new departments are joining the Erasmus+ project: Business and Pastry/Backery. This  Erasmus+ mobility is going to become a very powerful school project which will have a great impact on all of our  vocational departments.\r\nThe project  running team has decided to  rely on the most  qualified teachers in mobility activities from both departments to apply for a 24 month Erasmus+ project focusing  on  European citizenship , school dropout  and  youth unemployment. The choice of the participants has resulted  in  setting up a group of 184 students (boys/girls aged 16- 19 years old) who are completing year 2 and year 3 of their BTEC National Diploma  and are  attending European vocational  issue courses.\r\nTo meet our participants\u2019needs which are the enhancement and the acknowledgment of their vocational competences, our establishment relies on its international partners: a Polish hotel and catering High School since 2013 and very experienced international partners specialized in vocational training programs with whom strong links have been created during previous preparatory meetings to implement   vocational training courses and internship in local companies. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the mobility activities is to give our participants in year 2 and year 3 a different approach of the learning and the practice of their profession in order to improve and share their knowledge through cooking/service techniques and electricity / electronic applications :\r\n1. In Year 2 the participants will experience technical and theoretical training courses in an European school partner for two weeks in order to acquire different schemes of apprenticeship, to become more autonomous and to develop vocational objectives easy to reach in an unusual educational frame. They will be able to exchange their practice with their foreign counterparts in English and meet managers of local enterprises (restaurants/hotels/electricity and computing companies  )\r\n2. In year 3 the participants will be welcomed in foreign companies for four weeks in order to implement their working skills acquired in France, to adapt themselves to the requirements of their work placements and to expand a real autonomy in their apprenticeship and knowledge of a foreign language.\r\n In order to achieve the objectives of this project, the qualified teachers DNL/English use educational tools (E learning) and offer a remedial vocational teaching allowing the implementation of a specific training strategy adapted to the applicants\u2019 profile.\r\nThis preparation , prior to  the mobility period, spurs the motivated participants to be involved in their progress and to adapt themselves in a new vocational and linguistic environment.\r\nTo support this in-depth preparation, a thorough work from the project running team, in contact with the project partners and the participants\u2019 families, is done to ensure a control of logistic matters allowing a proper organization of the mobility activities from the start to the end.

In addition to a fight against isolationism and geographical immobility due to the fear of the other and the lack of economic means, we seek to better train our students, develop independence, enhance their path as a young student, reconcile them with the school and allow them to consider studies after graduating from secondary school.

Actions intended for the whole educational community are envisaged not to confine this project of European mobility only to the candidates going abroad, but to reach all our students. Two streams of voluntary student mobility (NVQ level 3) are planned: the 1st in March 2018 (year 2017-18), the 2nd in November 2018 (year 2018-19). We have chosen this level of study to respond to the concerns expressed by our partners regarding minors and to ensure better linguistic and technical preparation for our students who will be better able to perform complex tasks and can better benefit from this experience.\r\nWe take advantage of existing structures in our school like the Spanish European section to supervise the participants.

This heterogeneity will be exploited as an asset: the level 3 students will become the trainers of their cadets at the time of their mobility. In addition to reassuring future candidates, this will create a team spirit and a cooperation around Europe. An hour will also be available for other teachers to assist students in their workshop preparation or in other subjects such as labor law (eco-management, environmental & health prevention) and European citizenship (history and geography).

Our goal is to send abroad 136 youngsters aged from 16 to 20 and who are preparing one of the following French degrees in the fields of textile, fashion, leather or design: \u201cbaccalaur\u00e9at professionnel, brevet de technician, formation compl\u00e9mentaire poste bac\u201d (1-year training period). Our second goal is to send 10 adults who are being trained in one of the schools that is a member of the campus. The ultimate goal of this professional training period abroad is to allow our students to have a European dimension to their professional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in order to find work or continue their studies more easily. A professional training period abroad could also stimulate and motivate our students and help to fight against dropping out and bad results. We also wish to organize a period of mobility for 21 of our staff members in a professional training center and technological platform in another European country. This period could be very beneficial as it would allow us to discover new training techniques, new teaching methods to apply to mixed groups made of both adults and youngsters, and to organize an exchange with a European partner. Welcoming our partners in France would complete the experience and allow for innovation on both sides and allow 18 staff members from our European partner to take part in an individual mobility period in one of the structures of the host organization, the campus. This will allow both us and our partners to observe new methods, to exchange, to make the transfer of new methods possible. \r\nThe objectives are a part of the recommendations noted in the European reference documentation. The desire and the decision to propose these mobility periods in Europe corresponds to the specific needs of the actors of this professional field and to the aspirations of those being trained who wish to gain more skills and to find a job where such skills are needed. It also corresponds to the needs of our staff members who wish to exchange and innovate their own methods in order to make their students succeed and to open up new training periods with new subjects of study that correspond to the European job market.  \r\nWorking as a group has allowed us to find partners to welcome us in five different countries. Mutualizing these resources has been a key aspect to our mobility project. Il allows our schools to network abroad more efficiently, to stimulate the implication of French companies in the mobility project, to obtain better visibility of our schools and training facilities on a European level and to allow our students to continue their studies once they have completed their secondary school diploma. \r\nThis project is coherent with the local school board\u2019s policy to develop mobility periods abroad in this field of study. It is the result of wanting to work together to reinforce skills and methods of those who will take part in a mobility period and to allow the campus to be the initiator of the project. Mutualizing such means has allowed us to be much more dynamic in our approach to international mobility. \r\nThe content of this program has been defined and worked on with all of the secondary schools which have committed to respecting the different phases of the project: informing future participants, selecting them, preparing them to go abroad, evaluating the mobility period and diffusing contact lists. Thanks to the group work on the program content, the first documents such as an evaluation grid have been created. The group jointly decided on how to schedule the different phases of the program such as the preparation, the carrying out and the evaluation phases. It is this joint effort and coordination which will increase the value of the project for students and staff members. In fact, the different phases of the project implicate all of the Campus partners: vocational training schools and centers, universities, businesses, guilds, technological platforms. This project will also implicate actors such as consulates, associations, language assistants, comities in charge of twinning cities, cultural centers, both abroad and in France.\r\nThe role of each partner is clearly identified: Le GIPAL is in charge of the project from an administrative point of view.

During the period from 2015-2020 we are working towards targets of increasing our learner job outcome rate from 62% to 70% and maintaining the proportion of learners progressing to further training at 18%, thus achieving an overall positive progression rate of 88% by 2020.\r\n\r\nKey elements of this work will include incorporating international perspectives within the vocational courses and learner support functions linked to mobility activities, including introducing European dimensions to curricula and facilitating international level employability and jobsearch support. This work is ongoing and will be reflected in this project via the inclusion of a new \u2018European Community Development\u2019 units within our Level 3 Award in Community Development, as well as the introduction of international vacancy bulletins and supported jobsearch services focusing on the community development and energy efficiency sectors in Spain, Italy and France.

Prior to and during mobilities they will liaise with the participants and their support agencies to identify any additional needs arising as a result of the undertaking the mobility, e.g. anxiety about living away from home or practical issues such as accommodation and housing support functions. Thus they will be able to support participants with difficult situations, for example lost passport, medical issues, etc, and liaise with local services and translate where necessary.\r\n\r\nAccompanying Persons will also ensure lines of communication between participants, DSC Regen and Host Employers remain open throughout the mobilities and also provide aftercare to ensure reintegration with support functions on return to the UK.
