Starting with efficient fulfilment of various customer demands the red line goes along efficient utilization of Big Data sources, present knowledge and critical new knowledge foreseen as outcomes from this project.\nTechnical development and mechanization has been a winning concept for high productivity now emphasizing more gentle methods and just in time deliveries to different industry customers. This is possible to reach if new knowledge, improved methods and technical development are combined with better transfer of information and data from different sources (e.g processes, geo data from LiDAR scanning, other conditions such as weather data etc).These Big Data sources have been available for some years, but it is not until recently that hardware, data communication and merging possibilities enable full potential for a revolution of new applications. \nIn the EFFORTE proposal we have identified three main subjects that have specific importance for efficiency, productivity and environmental concern in forest practice. Two of these implies to increasing crucial knowledge and the third, Big Data applications, combines the new knowledge with high resolution information sources into practice increasing efficiency in forest management and the connected value chains. The main objectives of EFFORTE are: i) To develop scientifically firm and techno-economically feasible methodology to predict trafficability prior to forest operations. ii) To increase forest growth and productivity of tree planting and young stand management iii) To develop, customize and pilot modern \u2018Big data\u2019 solutions that will increase productivity and decrease negative environmental impact (e.g. soil, water and reduced fuel consumption).

The Scottish government proposes that by 2020 all Scottish children from Nursery upwards will be learning a second language and a third language will be introduced from Primary 5.  To be ready for this, and to work alongside our local authority's approach to 1+2 languages, we need to address the learning and teaching of Modern Languages in our school.  Our cluster Secondary School has selected Spanish as the language to be introduced from Nursery and French to be taught from P5 onwards.  \r\n\r\nOur project aims to improve staff knowledge of the Spanish language and culture.  The project will enhance our teaching methodologies, including the use of ICT, and will guarantee that staff are trained, motivated and enthusiastic when sharing Spanish with pupils.  As a large school, which has dramatically increased in size over the last nine years, we need to ensure consistency in our approach and in the standard of learning and teaching of Spanish.  We also wish to broaden our international connections by setting up a link(s) with a Spanish school through eTwinning.  It is hoped that by implementing these objectives, Spanish will become embedded into daily school life and will be central to our curriculum development and planning. \r\n\r\nThree staff members have been selected to participate in a Languages for Education Europe (LFEE) Spanish Immersion Course in Malaga in July 2017.  The course will improve methodological expertise in the teaching of Spanish and will provide participants with resources suitable to bring back to our school.  It will help to develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary Spain, and will improve participants\u2019 competence and performance in Spanish.  It will incorporate the use of ICT resources in teaching Spanish.  After attending the language course, the participants will provide staff training to share their knowledge and highlight the new resources acquired.  This will enable the staff of 75 members to take Spanish learning and teaching forward, benefitting the 700 school pupils. \r\n\r\nRegular events and celebrations will be organised within the school to promote the importance of language learning and cultural awareness.  This will help to involve and inform parents, as well as the wider school community, of how our school is improving its learning and teaching of Spanish.  We will embed Spanish within the curriculum, using it in daily classroom life and introducing it through interdisciplinary projects.  Staff and pupil groups will be established to take forward Spanish within the school helping to gain fresh and new ideas.  This will provide children with a wide and rich range of Spanish learning activities to develop literacy and language skills .  This will enable them to become successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens; skills at the heart of the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence.  \r\n\r\nThis project will benefit all staff and pupils as well as the wider school community.  In the short-term, it will improve staff confidence and competence in teaching Spanish, whilst increasing our range of teaching methods and resources.  In the long term, we will have improved our school curriculum and linguistic ability in both staff and pupils.  We will be helping pupils to act as global citizens having made links with a Spanish school and brought a European dimension to our curriculum.  We will be equipping our pupils with essential life skills, getting them ready for the world of work.", "http://www.kinnaird.falkirk.sch.uk", "Kinnaird Primary", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035962_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "FK5"}
