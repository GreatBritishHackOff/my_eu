We are beginning to look at how the Scottish Government 1+2 Language Learning initiative can be best planned out for their pupils from P1 onwards, and the language of French eventually embedded through the school as their L2 (first language after mother tongue). As a large role in this, Heather Portsmouth, a class teacher and language ambassador for the school wishes to take part in a mobility project provided by LFEE Europe - a week long immersion course in Lyon, France in July 2017. Heather, at present, has basic skills in French and is open to new ideas. She enjoys being creative and is enthusiastic about bringing the teaching of French forward at Maud School.\r\nTaking part in the immersion course would primarily mean a deeper insight into French is gained which allows staff confidence and competency to be boosted. Through preparation for and immersion in the language throughout the course, Heather would build upon her own French talking, listening and writing skills. Importantly, we wish for Heather to gain new ideas, methodologies and resources to strengthen all of our class teacher's pedagogy in relation to regular, planned exposure to French throughout the school. As well as developing cultural awareness and gaining physical resources to take back to school on the course, Heather would also open up channels of communications between Scottish and French schools. We would also like the use of ICT to be integrated into this aspect of the schools connecting, making use of e-resources, portals and e-twinning. \r\nIn preparation and as part of the school's development plan for 1+2, Heather has already began attending methodology teaching French to young learners courses and trying out ideas with her infant class, has organised information sessions and meetings with school staff to feedback information and discuss the school's immediate next steps as well as upskilling her own French using apps and interactive resources. The class teachers have started trailing some of our already discussed strategies and resources within their classes gradually from now. Heather has planned to involve parents and the local community in the process of implementing 1+2 languages at Maud School. During the week long immersion course, Heather will partake in a number of language development classes, cultural trips, resources sharing / exchanging opportunities, language development day to day opportunities and visits to local French primary schools. On returning from the immersion course, Heather has planned to share her experiences with the local community - staff and pupils, as well as regionally in cluster groups throughout Aberdeenshire Council. Heather is planning to establish connections with French schools with her pupils immediately upon return, as well as organise sessions for other local participants of the course to evaluate and feedback what they've learned and tried. \r\nAt Maud School, we envisage that having an enthusiastic staff member take part in the immersion course will lead to a wealth of cultural knowledge and resources being gained surrounding the French language, therefore directly impacting on teaching and learning. Our own understanding of the language and greater cultural awareness will directly transfer to the pupils. Staff will have new, innovative ideas to try with the pupils and will be motivated to teach French embedded in other parts of the curriculum as their own language knowledge grows. Different active methods of teaching will be used and a direct source of information will be available through ICT connections and resources brought back from Lyon. Established links will keep the children motivated and their understanding of the general progression of all languages will be improved through progression in French. We will have a better understanding in the progression through oral French through to phonics and eventually writing. Pupils will enjoy French being a part of the school and will be motivated to talk to each other in the language, after joyfully recognising their own success in understanding French instructions and meaningful display words. The learning will be centered around the children and their interests which aids with engagement for all. Transition of language learning to secondary school will be enhanced. Ultimately, learning French from an early age will open up windows of opportunities for our children in modern Europe which may not be available to those with only one language. With an enthusiastic outlook on the learning of new languages in our school, we hope that the immersion course will give Heather the opportunity to help deliver teaching in line with the 1+2 policy advocated by the Scottish Government and also respond to the economic and cultural needs of the pupils as well as their interests.", null, "Maud School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036040_coordinator"], ["5FQ", "Mobilit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne en classe de baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel am\u00e9nagements paysagers", "Aden Country Park", 29992.0, "The family house of Mauleon is a private school with a contract with the ministry of Agriculture, training student from the year 9 to year 13, in order to prepare a vocational degree with the following courses :\r\n\r\n- year 9, year 10\r\n\r\n- diploma in landscape gardening (2 years)\r\n\r\n- bachelor in landscape gardening (3 years)\r\n\r\nAll these courses include training or apprenticeship.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe propose courses with training period and a special rythm (example: one week at school and two weeks at work)\r\n\r\n\r\nOur school works with a European network for several years in our area.
