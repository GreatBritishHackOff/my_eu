We want to consolidate progress across our whole school, and give a special focus to our primary language provision.\r\n\r\nA language is taught from Pre-school in EYFS and throughout KS1 and KS2 by specialist language teachers. The objective of the project is to train classroom teachers and teaching assistants to be able to support language teaching by improving their language competency and confidence. Our 18  participants include 4 teaching assistants based in EYFS and KS1&2, 1 SEN teacher based in KS1&2, 3 specialist language teachers, 5 EYFS, KS1 & KS2 class teachers, 5 KS3 teachers who also work with Prep classes and who are involved with transition from KS2.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve mobilities to France and Spain which will include an intensive language course and visits to our two link schools. \r\n\r\nBefore each mobility, staff will be given basic language training by the language teachers and will have their language competency assessed. They will be asked to complete a survey on their confidence and ability in languages. They will be briefed on the purposes of the project and asked to collect authentic resources and to consider how the methodologies they see could be used in their own lessons. \r\n\r\nAfterwards, they will complete a follow-up survey and be involved in the delivery of languages in Prep. \r\n\r\nActivities on the language course will include intensive language classes and information on language teaching activities which can be used with primary children. Emphasis will be made of the importance of communication and the benefits of encouragement in order to boost confidence. \r\n\r\nThe results of the project will include the following: \r\n\r\na set of \u2018minimum expectations\u2019 for primary classes regarding the use of a foreign language in everyday work,\r\n\r\nlanguages will be incorporated into the science/ geography/ history topics so that initially specialist teachers are delivering some topic work and eventually training class teachers to deliver it too,\r\n\r\na languages section will be added to the school website,\r\n\r\nlinks with two schools will be strengthened allowing more contact with native speakers; pupils will be more motivated to continue language study,\r\n\r\nmore pupils will take a language at GCSE,\r\n\r\nstaff will have the benefit of a language to add to their career development plan, and\r\n\r\nlocal primary schools will share resources produced by our project.", "http://www.oakhillcollege.co.uk", "Oakhill College (Whalley) Ltd", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035744_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["9PE", "RW4", "CALDERSTONES HOSPITAL"], ["4JX", "RW5", "CLITHEROE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"], ["4JX", "RXL", "LANCASHIRE BOWEL SCREENING SERVICE - CLITHEROE HOSPITAL"], ["4JX", "RXR", "CLITHEROE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BB7"}
