We are growing secondary school, with a  sixth form. We have 912 students and 160 staff.\r\n\r\nOur students are predominantly from White British backgrounds with growing numbers Black Minority Ethnic pupils. 10% of our years 7 to 11 have English as an Additional Language, significantly more compared with the numbers when we applied for our 2015 project\r\n\r\nWe completed a successful large scale Erasmus + project  (2014-1-UK101-002101) in the Summer of 2014, and detailed information on this can be found in the final report of that project. Our successful management of all aspects of that project demonstrate that we have the ability to manage the strategic, financial and professional aspects of a large project effectively.\r\n\r\nThe project has helped us to develop language, pedagogy,  training scheme development, dissemination, project and financial management skills. which we are now keen to build on.\r\n\r\nOur 2014 Erasmus+ project impacted greatly on our school life. We not only met but exceeded our targets and have created a huge change in our school in terms of quality of teaching and learning, embedding the European dimension, and supporting others. We are determined not to lose this impetus and we are clear what the next steps will be to build on our success, involving more staff and more countries\r\n\r\nThis project will involve immersion courses abroad, sending 20 members of staff to each of the following countries; Spain, France, Italy, Germany. This will be a total of 80 mobilities. We intend to involve different members of staff each time, with the exception of the International coordinator (IC) who will be involved in all 4 countries to take a lead on the development of school links and joint curricular projects, and some members of the MFL team to respond to their individual needs (i.e  some may focus particularly on one country while others may need to upskill in more than one language). Participants will represent different departments across the school and a mix of roles including teaching and support staff and senior managers.\r\n\r\nThis project will result in further fundamental changes to our approach to language teaching and integrating the European dimension in our school. Internationalism will become even further embedded and will be seen in all subject areas. Planning formats will continue to evolve to reflect changes.\r\n\r\nMore staff will be equipped with the necessary skills to embed the European dimension further and create strong links between languages and their own subject. They will have the skills to provide support for others including partner primary schools and other schools within our cluster, increasing our capacity to perform our role as a centre of excellence and support.\r\n\r\nWe will have the capacity to offer support to a greater number of local schools and will extend our role as a training provider and source of support. More staff members will be equipped with the knowledge, skills and experience to support others to improve standards within their subject. We will also be more flexible in terms of the support we can offer and the range of languages.\r\n\r\nWe will have wide representation from many departments  to fully establish the whole school approach of this project. We would like our participants to come from different roles and backgrounds within the school, for example teachers, support staff, learning partnerships staff, behaviour managers etc.\r\n\r\nWe have been conducting an evaluation of our current project, and plan to use a similar process to evaluate this one. Our approach is to set baselines against which to measure our progress in all of the areas that we want to focus on during this project. We perform evaluations during the activity to ensure that we are on track to achieve our aims and will conduct a final evaluation at the end.\r\n\r\nWe use various means of  evaluation, relevant to each area we wish to assess. These include use of formal schools performance systems, pupil voice and parents surveys, questionnaires and opinion polls. we look at children's work, teachers' planning and undertake regular, informal assessments. We use lesson observations and measure uptake of languages and extracurricular opportunities. We observe pupils' attitude towards taking part in activities and assess their reaction to proposed future developments such as pupil exchanges. We also ask for formal feedback from other groups that we work with, for example other schools within the Ormiston Trust, and our partner primary schools.", "http://www.ormistonvictoryacademy.co.uk", "Ormiston Victory Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035751_coordinator"], ["0RR", "Languages at Costessey : onwards and upwards.", "Costessey Junior School", 22791.0, "Costessey Junior is on the outskirts of Norwich and has 355 children. The school is an inclusive learning community where children feel safe and valued within a creative and supportive environment. \r\n\r\nCostessey Infant School, although separate from the Costessey Junior School, shares the same Head Teacher and Management team.  Over the coming years, our plan is to combine with Costessey Infant School to become one large school. Our schools will be working in partnership with respect to this Project but we understand that we need to make separate applications for funding.\r\n\r\nBoth schools currently lack the expertise to teach languages to the standard we would like to and embed language and cultural understanding into the school ethos.\r\n\r\nWe want to equip our staff with the skills, teaching strategies and confidence to generate a love for language learning, encourage teaching languages in class time and support embedding languages across the curriculum.\r\n\r\nWe would like our staff the chance to develop their skills in both French and Spanish. \r\n\r\nWe need to involve staff from different roles and ensure that all staff, including those who do not directly take part in mobilities, are fully engaged and involved in the process and have the skills to play an active role in developing language awareness across our school.\r\n\r\nThe majority of our staff are absolute beginners in French/Spanish, and we therefore need to greatly boost their language skills, cultural awareness and confidence to enable them to confidently teach the requirements of the KS2. \r\n\r\nThis will be a two-year project involving 10 immersion courses each to  France and Spain, 4 each to France and Spain for our infant schoopl and 6 each to France and Spain for our Junior school..\r\n\r\nThe particular courses involve language, culture, methodology and school links. The beginner\u2019s course has a strong focus on language awareness, making links and looking for patterns in the language. \r\n\r\nCourses will also equip participants with the skills and confidence to support colleagues on their return to school and contribute towards building a sustainable whole school approach to languages. \r\n\r\nParticipants will have the opportunity when in Spain and France to gather appropriate and effective materials and will also be familiarised with new teaching resources. This will help us to give our pupils more authentic learning experiences.\r\n\r\nWe will particularly focus on gathering resources and ideas that will help us to embed a cross curricular approach to the teaching of languages with particular links to literacy. \r\n\r\nWe would like to move away from our current provision to developing a consistent, whole school approach which is in line with our general teaching approach and where languages are embedded into our curriculum and the daily life of our school. \r\n\r\nThe project will result in languages being taught more consistently and to a higher standard across our school and our partner Junior School\r\n\r\nLanguages will be fully embedded into every aspect of our school life with links between subjects, a focus on language and literacy, French and Spanish used on a regular basis as part of our everyday routines, and languages being visible across the whole school.\r\n\r\nOur language teaching will be more in line with our general whole school approach to teaching and learning in that it will be part of cross curricular approach.", "http://www.costesseyjunior.co.uk/", "Costessey Junior School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036337_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NR5"}
