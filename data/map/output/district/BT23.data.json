There is strong need to protect people, the societal community and critical infrastructures and utilities against being damaged, destroyed or disrupted by deliberate acts of terrorism. Solutions have to be derived to realize sufficient resilience of the urban infrastructure for rare occasions with minimum effect on normality. Hitherto, normal regulations and building guidelines do not take into account the CBRE threat. Fortunately, the required specialist knowledge is available on explosion dynamics, response of structures, dispersions of toxic agents and the injuries. This knowledge should be explored to derive the required solutions. Therefore, the SPIRIT Consortium was formed to bring the required expertise together, make these commonly available and to find solutions that can be integrated into normal life and planning and building procedures. Within SPIRIT a terrorist attack with the whole scope of CBRE-threat is addressed. The main outcome of the project is an integrated approach to counter CBRE-threats, including proposed guidelines for a EU Regulatory Framework. With this approach, government, end users of buildings and designers can define and achieve a desired level of protection. The SPIRIT contribution to built infrastructure protection will be: - A methodology to quantify the vulnerability of built infra in damage, number of injuries and loss of functionality and services; - A guidance tool to assess the vulnerability and define efficient and effective countermeasures to achieve a required protection level; - Draft guidelines to enable safety based engineering and the incorporation of CBRE protection; - A suite of ready to use CBRE countermeasure products.

This led to tools for designers and builders to measure and categorise vulnerability, as well as to identify efficient and cost-effective mitigation strategies.\n\nThe partners compiled an extensive database of CBRE protective security and safety products like resistant window systems, a retrofit system for walls, explosion-resistant columns, and detection and filtration systems for use by the European Commission, governments and related stakeholders. The database includes product effectiveness, cost and improvement.\n\nAll project outcomes were integrated into a comprehensive, software-based risk assessment tool developed by the researchers. This tool first defines the dimension, layout and structural components of a multi-storey building, followed by the CBRE scenario. The data enables users to estimate the risks and aftermath of CBRE attacks on a building.\n\nThe SPIRIT tool provides risk measures for structural damage, casualties and economic loss. This data can be used for such countermeasures as structural enhancements, evacuation and air quality management.\n\nSPIRIT has designed solutions to keep people who occupy large modern buildings as safe as possible.

PREPARATION\r\nThe educational stuff of our school prepare plans, submite ideas and activities in order to have satisfactory results. They have permanent communication with colleagues in Europe for an efficient cooperation.\r\n\r\n2. DESIGN A WEEKLY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME \r\nThe teachers of our school organize two programmes that they will realized when we'll host our partners of Europe.\r\nProgramme 1-The development of children' mental health and emotional empathy via Arts (music-drama in education-paintings). It will be based on playing that is the most important tool in pre-school education.\r\nProgramme 2- Environmental programme with outdoor activities and stimulies from Arts.

The items that will be elaborated are: mental health, environmental education and fialanagnosia. One of our teachers will go to Ireland and the other one to Spain.  Three teachers from Ireland will be hosted in our school and two from Spain.\r\n\r\n4. EVALUATION\r\nThe evaluation will be realized throughout the program so as for possible shortcomings to be pointed out and improving changes to be planned by means of questionnaires, interviews and videos. Evaluation will be realized at the end of the program too, for drawing conclusions and future reflection.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. EXPIRY-DIFFUSSION \r\n   a.

We want to develop a nursery with children's play at its heart. A vibrant nursery, bubbling over with daily adventures, imagination, creativity, curiosity, ingenuity, exploration, challenge and fun. A secure home, away from home, where children 'Play to Learn'. \r\n\r\nWe believe that children learn best through open-ended play, and place great value on their acquisition of the so called, 'soft skills' of collaboration, concentrating, resilience, using one's own initiative, questioning, testing, risk taking, taking responsibility for one's own actions, empathy etc. These 'soft skills' are the foundations, upon which, all future learning will be built.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a new provider, we are aware of our relative inexperience and the need to develop our professional skills and competences as early years practitioners. We need to learn when and how to intervene and interact with the children to enrich their learning experiences.  We also need to develop and enhance our skills and competences in the organisation, management and day-to-day running of our nursery unit.\r\n\r\nTo that end, we have applied for an Erasmus+ KA1 grant to enable us to achieve our objectives for our pupils' learning, for our staff's professional development and the effective operation of our nursery unit. Our partners in Greece and Estonia are applying simultaneously for a similar KA1 grant. \r\n\r\nWe propose to send six members of staff, chosen from our Senior Management and Early Years' Teams to International Conferences in Iceland and Spain, around the theme of Play-based Learning. It is hoped that the training and knowledge our staff receive will inspire and empower them to take forward this innovative play-based approach to the curriculum.\r\n\r\nThey will further investigate a play-based, experiential approach to learning, by travelling to pre-schools in Greece and Estonia, to observe best practice; to shadow colleagues; to team teach with them; to learn together in workshops around pre-agreed themes; and to enter into a professional dialogue with their staff. \r\n\r\nWe believe that, our participation in this international learning community will help us develop as early years practitioners and will provide a creative force in our pre-school, transforming and enriching our children's learning experiences, empowering them, developing their self-esteem and promoting positive attitudes as they \u2018Play to Learn\u2019. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we believe that our more experienced partners from Greece and Estonia, will benefit from reciprocal visits to Northern Ireland, and that together we will enhance the International profile of our schools.

Widen staff participation in European mobility opportunities for professional development purposes - upskilling staff in technical areas, and education and industry developments to expand their teaching capabilities; gaining knowledge from learning and teaching pedagogies; and developing personal competences associated with collaborative projects such as organisational and communication skills. This is a key focus of SERC's Staff Development Policy.\r\n\r\nThe key results expected for the learners include a meaningful industry experience with increased technical knowledge and professional skills in their chosen sector - working with professionals applying and improving upon what they have learned on their course and learning new techniques and methods. For Construction this will be practical application of learned methodologies and project work, IT learners will develop skills in using IT for communications, Sports learners will develop skills in coaching children, for Performing Arts this will be in backstage skills, for Early Years it will be in carrying out activities and reflecting on their own practice, and specific practice in Reggio Emilia and Montesorri, Travel and Tourism will learn digital marketing skills for the industry, Animal Management will develop skills in exotic animal care, and Catering learn traditional baking techniques. Further to the skills relating to their qualifications and industry, the project aims to develop other personal, social and employability skills valued by employers that a traineeship, and particularly a work experience abroad, offers such as self-management, teamwork, leadership, communication, problem solving, decision making and organisational skills. It will provide the learners with a better understanding of the workplace skills needed and how to learn from the placement to set career-related goals.\r\n\r\n'SEE 2' will also impact on the professional development of staff through the upskilling of staff in all partners.
