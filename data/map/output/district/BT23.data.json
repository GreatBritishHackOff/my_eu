There is strong need to protect people, the societal community and critical infrastructures and utilities against being damaged, destroyed or disrupted by deliberate acts of terrorism. Solutions have to be derived to realize sufficient resilience of the urban infrastructure for rare occasions with minimum effect on normality. Hitherto, normal regulations and building guidelines do not take into account the CBRE threat. Fortunately, the required specialist knowledge is available on explosion dynamics, response of structures, dispersions of toxic agents and the injuries. This knowledge should be explored to derive the required solutions. Therefore, the SPIRIT Consortium was formed to bring the required expertise together, make these commonly available and to find solutions that can be integrated into normal life and planning and building procedures. Within SPIRIT a terrorist attack with the whole scope of CBRE-threat is addressed. The main outcome of the project is an integrated approach to counter CBRE-threats, including proposed guidelines for a EU Regulatory Framework. With this approach, government, end users of buildings and designers can define and achieve a desired level of protection. The SPIRIT contribution to built infrastructure protection will be: - A methodology to quantify the vulnerability of built infra in damage, number of injuries and loss of functionality and services; - A guidance tool to assess the vulnerability and define efficient and effective countermeasures to achieve a required protection level; - Draft guidelines to enable safety based engineering and the incorporation of CBRE protection; - A suite of ready to use CBRE countermeasure products. The overall goal of the SPIRIT project is to contribute to people safety and increase the resilience of built infrastructure against a terrorist attack.", 417355.0, 4122557.0, "SPIRIT", "Enhancing security of large buildings", "The consequences of terrorist acts on people, buildings and related infrastructure can be devastating. An EU initiative helped to provide state-of-the-art tools to mitigate the effects of terrorist attacks.", "There is a real need to protect government structures, malls, and train and subway stations from chemical, biological, radiological and explosive (CBRE) threats. However, existing technology and know-how do not sufficiently counteract fatalities and injuries, damage to buildings, and the loss of capacity and services.\n\nThanks to the EU-funded 'Safety and protection of built infrastructure to resist integral threats' (http://www.infrastructure-protection.org (SPIRIT)) project, researchers developed tools to reduce damage, destruction and disruption to large new and existing buildings.\n\nA risk assessment was carried out to demonstrate how susceptible a building is to attack. This led to tools for designers and builders to measure and categorise vulnerability, as well as to identify efficient and cost-effective mitigation strategies.\n\nThe partners compiled an extensive database of CBRE protective security and safety products like resistant window systems, a retrofit system for walls, explosion-resistant columns, and detection and filtration systems for use by the European Commission, governments and related stakeholders. The database includes product effectiveness, cost and improvement.\n\nAll project outcomes were integrated into a comprehensive, software-based risk assessment tool developed by the researchers. This tool first defines the dimension, layout and structural components of a multi-storey building, followed by the CBRE scenario. The data enables users to estimate the risks and aftermath of CBRE attacks on a building.\n\nThe SPIRIT tool provides risk measures for structural damage, casualties and economic loss. This data can be used for such countermeasures as structural enhancements, evacuation and air quality management.\n\nSPIRIT has designed solutions to keep people who occupy large modern buildings as safe as possible. By introducing safety-based engineering and CBRE protection for public or private infrastructure, the project outcomes are slated to revolutionise building security.", null, "http://www.Tecdur.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/153193.jpg", "fp7_95261_996005701"], ["4YH", "SMART TRACKING OF AIR POLLUTION BY A BIKE LIGHT", "Limeforge Ltd", "Currently, cities perform air quality monitoring by static and sparse stations that to large cities cost about \u20ac 4 Mill. These systems do not offer robust, tempo-spatial heterogeneous measures to take efficient decisions. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we have developed TRACKER, a sensor device adapted for bikes that provides a cost effective way for cities to deploy mobile sensor networks. TRACKER combines sensor technology with Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) communications technology, providing an autonomous sensor platform which can be integrated into Bike Sharing Schemes. Also, it has movement sensor and theft alert.\nSee.Sense is a successful company founded in 2013 to develop bike devices that collect data to improve resource usage and infrastructure for citizens. We have commercialised 2 cycling products which has allowed us to double our revenue each year and received multitude of awards. Cities as Dublin, Belfast, Milton Keynes (leader in smart cities) have trusted in us.\nWe aim at disrupting into the Smart Cities Market-estimated to grow from \u20ac 281 Bill (2015) to \u20ac 683 Bill (2020). Our target market, Bike sharing systems, is settled in more than 1,000 cities in 50 countries. TRACKER is a patent pending technology for what we have invested \u20ac 0.5 Mill to take to TRL 6. We plan to start our sales in Dublin and Boston where we are performing tests. \nYet, we still need to test network coverage, and get our technology validated by the end-users as well as develop a plan dissemination and exploitation activities.\nThus, we have decided to continue with TRACKER for what we need an additional investment of \u20ac 3 Mill, that will give us a ROI of 7.0 by 2024.

To implement this transition, these industries must reach, at least, the same level of crash performance achieved with metals, but at significantly lower weight and without increasing cost. This is viewed by industry as an exceptionally challenging goal and will require highly trained engineers, versed in the myriad aspects of designing cost-effective, crashworthy composites structures, and capable of harnessing the latest research developments in the fast-changing world of composites. The ICONIC ETN aims to cultivate such a new generation of young engineers; comfortable and fluent in the integration and exploitation of knowledge from fields as diverse as materials science, chemistry, computational methods, solid and damage mechanics, textile technology, structural design and optimisation. These researchers will acquire the skills to enable the sustainable and economically-viable design of a new generation of highly efficient, lightweight transportation composite structures that will provide the maximum protection to occupants through superior crashworthiness. 15 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) will be recruited to take up posts, across the UK, Ireland, Greece, Germany, Italy and Sweden, in an innovative, multidisciplinary and intersectoral structured research and training programme.
