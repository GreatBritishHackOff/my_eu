Our school is situated in a deprived area, and so many of our learners have never had the chance to experience another culture or language. Our project aims to broaden the horizons for these pupils. Our project has clear objectives. Firstly, we intend to raise the confidence in the delivery of Spanish in our school. Despite many courses having been attended, the majority of teachers in our school still struggle with  the teaching of Spanish, citing it as being the subject that they are least confident in teaching. This is due to a range of factors including their own Spanish speaking ability, as well as lack of ideas in how to make Spanish lessons as enriching as possible. The second aim of the project is to provide teachers with pedagogy, skills and ideas that will enable to school to adapt the curriculum and the way in which we teach MFL. By providing a more enriching curriculum, rather than following a scheme as we currently do, we hope that children will be inspired by the new immersive way of learning. Our next objective is to provide children with a greater understanding of other cultures. Through members of staff visiting Spain, we can roll out a school wide focus on exploring the Spanish culture. We hope to provide our learners and the community new experiences and understanding of different cultures and to raise aspirations. Finally, we hope to extend our new learning and share best practice, not only across our own school but with other schools in our trust. The project will involve a 5 day trip to Spain. This trip is clearly structured and ensures that our time in Spain is used most effectively. The project will focus on sessions to improve language and cultural knowledge through evaluation of teaching techniques and methodology. This will focus on constructing sentences using familiar vocabulary, addressing how to encourage learners to produce spontaneous language, story telling and books to promote cultural understanding and reading skills, using ICT and other materials including short and long films as a didactic resource, using songs to develop listening and comprehension skills and exploring how art work can be used to develop language and writing skills. As well as this, the course will offer the opportunity to visit local schools to observe best practice, networking opportunities, meeting and sharing ideas with other participants from the UK and exploring the local area. The participants will be 2 teachers from the school who teach Spanish weekly. They will be teachers who are identified as lacking in confidence and being the most receptive to the training opportunities provided. Alongside this, we will be ensuring that those who are selected will be the most suitable candidates to deliver training to our school and our trust schools upon return and oversee the implementation of a new, immersive modern foreign language curiculum delivery. During the project, participants will be completing daily reflections on their learning and any new skills acquired, and upon return to the United Kingdom, will be completing a Europass Mobility form to ensure that all new skills and evidence of this is documented more officially. We envisage the project having a great impact on the teaching and learning of Spanish in our school. We expect to see an impact with the participants themselves, who will become much more confident in their understanding and delivery of the teaching of Spanish and it's application within the school. Delivery of their learning to the rest of the school staff, both teaching and support staff will ensure that there is an understanding of the teaching of modern foreign languages and that new ideas, pedagogy and curriculum coverage can be implemented throughout the school.  This in turn will lead to greater Spanish learning in our organisation and a school of learners who are confident and excited Spanish speakers. This will be achieved through the new ideas and the new immersive curriculum that will be extended in the school.  We hope to see the impact on the local community and also on the wider school. We hope to encourage an understanding and acceptance of other cultures, as well as a curiosity that we hope will be harboured by our pupils and by extension the local community to extend themselves further than the perimeters of the city that they already know. We have a great vision for the long term. We envisage our pupils being confident Spanish speakers who are excited to learn a new language. Most importantly, we are aiming to have a school of learners who have had their aspirations raised and their understanding and curiosity of the world widened. We hope to raise a school, and Trust, of internationally minded children with enriching and varied future careers.", "http://www.westonmill.plymouth.sch.uk/website", "Weston Mill Community Primary Academy", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023252_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PL2"}
