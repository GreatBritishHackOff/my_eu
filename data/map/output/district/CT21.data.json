Among all RE sources, wind energy is currently viewed as one of the most significant fastest growing (at an average annual growth rate of more that 26% since 1990), commonly used and commercially attractive source to generate electrical energy.\n\nThe vision of the wind industry in Europe is to increase wind\u2019s fraction of electrical energy mix to more than 20% within the next 2 decades. To implement this, an average 10-15GW of additional capacity must be manufactured, delivered and implemented every year in Europe. In order to achieve this, further improvements in wind turbine technology are still needed. Wind turbines are not new concepts but still face challenges as a stable and reliable source of energy \u2013 issues with efficiency, operations, maintenance and its general costs.\n\nThere is a need to reduce the rate of electrical system faults and the corresponding downtime per fault which will contribute significantly to the overall reduction of the operational and maintenance cost associated with current and future wind turbines.  This project aims to develop an advanced diagnostics and predictive maintenance intelligent sensor system network for Wind Turbine (with particular focus on faults, failures and breakdowns relating to the electrical system of the wind turbine).", 405936.0, 1161629.0, "WIND TURBARS", "A sensible solution to wind turbine electrical faults", "Wind turbine electrical system failures result in extended downtime, increasing operating costs and decreasing energy security. New on-board sensor technology and predictive tools will enable timely attention to potential problems.", "Among renewable sources of energy, wind is one of the most commercially attractive to help meet electricity needs and relieve dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nThe technology is quite mature, with an average annual growth rate of more than 26\u00a0% since 1990.\n\nHowever, EU targets of covering 20\u00a0% of electricity needs with wind energy within the next 2 decades require further improvements to enhance reliability and decrease operating costs.Reducing system faults can address both challenges for present and future wind turbines.\n\nEU-funded scientists are developing an intelligent sensor network for advanced diagnostics and predictive maintenance of electrical systems within the scope of the project http://www.windturbars.eu/ (WIND TURBARS) .The consortium successfully developed a model of the electrical components of a wind turbine  - g  generator, active rectifier, inverter and output filter.\n\nData modelling of normal operation has produced the starting point for evaluation of failure initiation and simulation of key electrical faults identified with a thorough literature review.For signatures of degradation modes for the faults being considered partners have assessed a number of mathematical tools and their suitability.\n\nProgress has demonstrated that degradation can be detected weeks or even months before actual.Modelling and simulation work led to the identification of candidate sensors and initial component selection.\n\nIn addition, based on the costs associated with electrical failures, the team has set a reasonable target price for the final sensor network system.WIND TURBARS diagnostic and predictive technology will address wind turbine electrical faults before they affect operation.\n\nThe sensor network is expected to have huge impact on development of offshore farms given the extreme difficulties associated with inspection and repair.\n\nBenefits for onshore and retrofit markets are important as well.\n\nOverall, the project stands to make a significant contribution to the EU's renewable energy goals by increasing the energy security afforded by sustainable and eco-friendly wind power.", "http://www.windturbars.eu/", "http://www.hvwooding.co.uk/", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112141.jpg", "fp7_106156_965700476"], ["6HG", "Universal Failsafe IGBT Package for robust power transmission", "H v Wooding Limited", "Through a mixture of applied research and development, the Uni-Pack project will deliver technologies to reduce the manufacturing costs and improve the performance of plastic packaged IGBT (Insulated gate bipolar transistor) modules, in particular those for use in Voltage Source Converters (VSC) for High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) power transmission. VSC technology enables efficient access to renewable energy sources and economic connection to the electric utilities grid. Trade studies have identified target IGBT module performance parameters for the HVDC market sector and the need to address the influence of gate drive strategies on converter cell/ module performance. Tailoring of IGBT structures for on-state/ switching loss trade-off across each market sector will be demonstrated and applied to develop 4.5KV enhanced DMOS and /or trench IGBT die exhibiting optimum performance for HVDC transmission.\nApplied research into a high thermal performance low profile package, designed for low inductance and having fully bonded interconnects will deliver step improvements in performance / reliability and reduced manufacturing cost. An important characteristic of the package will be its capability to fail to short circuit, a feature which is highly beneficial in reducing the system costs.\nA VSC system is currently in the design stage using standard IGBT modules and this will be used as a benchmark to demonstrate and quantify the degree of success.", 70466.0, 1247016.0, "UniPack", "Reliable high-voltage power transmission", "Failing stacked switches in voltage source converters (VSCs) can lead to loss of power, causing disruption to processes. New technology provides an innovative route to avoid power losses in the plurality of power transmission and distribution applications.", "Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) modules are commonly used in VSCs for voltage switching applications. A short circuit in IGBTs causes high-voltage spikes that cause failure in stacked IGBTs, resulting in power blackouts and significant losses.\n\nBacked by EU funding, the 'Universal failsafe IGBT package for robust power transmission' (http://www.fp7-unipack.eu/ (UNIPACK)) project developed an intrinsic fail-safe mechanism that fails to short circuit, thereby maintaining continuity of power transmission in all applications. The fail-safe IGBT module can operate at 4.5\u00a0kilovolts and 900\u00a0amperes.\n\nThe project exploited shape memory alloy (SMA) compositions for fail-safe components and transient liquid-phase jointing materials such as nano-silver. Other achievements were the development of test benches to characterise SMA compositions and the VSC device.\n\nUNIPACK technology is a retrofit product. Together with the new-build market, this factor also opens up the replacement and maintenance market. The universal design of the UNIPACK device enables its operation in both stacked and non-stacked applications.\n\nA number of different power transmission and distribution applications should benefit from UNIPACK technology. These include chopper converters for direct current (DC) traction motor drives, voltage source inverters for alternating current (AC) motor drives and rectifiers for AC-DC conversion in rail traction.\n\nUNIPACK technology should offer much-needed confidence by ensuring continuity of power supply with the lowest possible losses. Efficient high-voltage switching should also enable the increased use of energy from renewable energy sources such as offshore wind farms with lower losses and lesser risks of power failure.
