This process presents many opportunities, for example more involvement for the pupils in projects. There is also the need, however, to align this flexibility to the growing and changing demands of our students. One of the school's core themes is literature/art and we would like to strengthen and expand this field at different levels and with different age groups, with a special focus on Drama. Job shadowing as well as training courses (two participants) shall contribute to a professionalisation of our colleagues and an improving interconnection that gives special importance to the learning of foreign languages.\r\n\r\nCLIL is another domain in which we would like to professionalise and improve the existing curriculum as it is a most motivating experience for our pupils to discover English as a tool to communicate better. \r\n\r\nThree colleagues would be sent to training courses, all of them language teachers who would have the chance to experience the enriching atmosphere of such a course, not only with regard to methods and teaching, but also in the sense of internationalisation and networking with other European colleagues. This is valid also for ICT - thanks to a huge renovation of our school we have been provided with excellent tools that could still be incorporated even better into everyday teaching. Here we are hoping for fresh ideas from a training course.\r\n\r\nAll these measures for the professionalisation of interdisciplinary teaching are supposed to lead to specific results, such as the development/expansion of curricula and in internal training courses for colleagues in ICT. \r\n\r\nIn the long run we hope for these measures to help us to offer our pupils demanding yet supportive courses and projects that are in accord with our main school objectives and further foster the internationalisation of our curriculum/school.", "http://www.qeliz.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE03-KA101-000686_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DL3"}
