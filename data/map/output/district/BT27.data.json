This exchange is based on many years experience of undertaking exchanges to different parts of the world but the particular focus of this exchange is to allow young people from disadvantaged communities in Northern Ireland and Poland to work together in the different jurisdictions to help low income people build housing for themselves. We have selected Poland not only because we have a strong relationship with Habitat Poland but because we want to expose young people in Northern Ireland to the culture of Poland and help counter some of the negative views held by some in Northern Ireland in relation to Poles and east Europeans generally. This negativity has recently been most manifest in attacks on Polish people in disadvantaged communities in Northern Ireland where the participants for this programme will come from. \r\nThe participants in both countries will generally have less formal education qualifications and less employment opportunities when they leave school and this project is designed to help boost their confidence and skills. The key activity in this project will be the respective teams helping to build a home for low income families which as well as helping provide housing will give them a keen awareness of the needs of people without homes or in inadequate homes. Our experience is that the team building involved in this process can be life changing for young people.\r\nWe want to use this project not only to increase the skills and leadership potential of individuals but as a demonstration project to show what can happen when young people get together to do something  positive in their communities. We will be particularly keen to share the impact of the project through local media and community networks as it take place and when it is completed which we think will do a lot to enhance relations between the local communities and their non national neighbours.", "http://www.habitatni.co.uk", "Habitat For Humanity Northern Ireland", "erasmus_2015-2-UK01-KA105-014096_coordinator"], ["5EA", "Developing Youth Programs for Habitat for Humanity", "Habitat For Humanity Northern Ireland", 11188.0, "Habitat for Humanity is an international non-profit charity organization working to provide decent and affordable housing to those in need. Even though Habitat offices co-operate worldwide, it's employees do not have many structured opportunities to meet and interact in a creative way to develop, expand and improve their programmes for young people.Our Erasmus project described above is aimed to help our European offices in exchanging knowledge and experiences related to working with youth, schools and youth organizations, and to collate best practices and key-learnings for future use and program development.Our schedule contains: site visit to built close relationships with HFH workers; panels and workshops to create the best policies and to create new concepts for the events and programs for youth. based on sharing knowledge and experiences from already exisiting programs. It will involve 12 participants from 6 countries. All participants have extensive experience in NGO sector and working with youth in different fields. They are also very interested in developing their knowledge and skills. Each project activity will involve young volunteers who will be our partners in all dialogues regarding new concepts for youth programs in HFH.To achieve our goals participants will meet in each country at a study visits, workshops and meetings with local youth and each other. Each meeting will help HFH employees  (who are focused on youth programs) to verify the need and possibilities for development of our organization in the field of youth.Each workshop will focus on a different program and activity of our NGO and it will tackle the issue how we can involve youth into those activities(for example: fundraising, advocacy, volunteering, working with schools. The project will also involve meetings at schools, meetings with young volunteers.As a result of the project more young people will have the opportunity to engage in the important cause of our organization. Young people will gain access to new opportunities and have the chance to develop and improve their skills which will then continue to help them in education and professional training and also life in general.HFH staff across the region will improve their capacity to develop and manage exceptional international and local youth volunteering programs based on the latest needs of young people. Thanks to this project our organization will have a real opportunity for an international partnership with faster and improved communication lines that will help with future knowledge sharing and problem solving.Internal and external communications of the report, evaluation materials and training materials, will provide Habitat with a framework and knowledge platform to transfer and implement new strategies and a better youth program across Europe and worldwide.", "http://www.habitatni.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PL01-KA105-025822_5"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["4AA", "Stepping Stones to Employment", "STEPPING STONES NI", null, "ESF", 2451194.8, 3771068.92, "esf_ni_24"], ["4AA", "Stepping Stones Youth Service", "STEPPING STONES NI", null, "ESF", 248408.0, 382168.0, "esf_ni_41"], ["4AA", "Youth Service", "STEPPING STONES NI", null, "ESF", 94450.0, 236124.0, "esf_ni_115"], ["4AA", "Gatelodge Training and Employment Services", "STEPPING STONES NI", null, "ESF", 230078.0, 575195.0, "esf_ni_116"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT27"}
