Software protection is therefore utterly important; it can be a maker and breaker in domains like multi-screen mobile TV, software licensing, and credentials and sensitive data stored on mobile devices. However, current software protection techniques are incredibly hard to deploy. Moreover, they cost too much and limit innovation. Therefore many stakeholders in mobile devices need more trustworthy, cheaper software security solutions and more value for the money they spend on security.In this project, three market leaders in security ICT solutions and four academic institutions join forces to protect the assets of service, software and content providers. From their perspective, mobile devices and their users, which can engage in so-called Man-At-The-End (MATE) attacks, are not trustworthy.Our goal is to establish trustworthy software execution on untrusted mobile platforms that have a persistent or occasional network connection to a trusted entity at their disposal. With the ASPIRE solutions, we want mobile software security to become (1) trustworthy by leveraging on the available network connection and developing a layered security approach of strong protections; (2) measurable by developing practical metrics based on validated attack and protection models; (3) cheaper by integrating support for the protections into an industrial-strength ASPIRE Framework; (4) more valuable by enabling shorter time-to-markets; and (5) more productive by being more widely applicable.To provide software protection that is equally strong as the existing hardware-based protection, we will develop software protection techniques along five mutually strengthening lines of defense: data hiding, algorithm hiding, anti-tampering, remote attestation, and renewability. We will integrate compiler support for all lines of defense into the framework to enable service, software and content providers to automatically protect the assets in their mobile apps with the most appropriate local and network-based protection techniques. A decision support system will assist non-security-expert software developers to tune the tool chain for their assets and protection needs. This decision support system will reduce their time-to-market and lower their market entry ticket price.

Frequently speed and efficacy do not stem from the ignorance of procedures, but from the difficulty to operate in contexts where consistent damages are occurring, for the difficulty of managing emotional aspects. Training plays an important function to the preparation of the crisis manager. Currently two main modalities for training purpose are two: table top exercise and real world simulation exercise.

In Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East, peace and war exist in parallel and contemporary peace support operations simultaneously involve combat operations and building peace. Hence, the goal of establishing just and durable peace is a fundamental challenge to contemporary peacemakers and academics alike. In order to shed new theoretical and conceptual light on the problematique of building just and durable peace and to offer policy-relevant advice, the team JAD-PbP has identified three critical challenges, which constitute the core of the proposal. The first challenge focuses on the quest for justice in contemporary peace processes, which has become increasingly apparent as several violent conflicts and wars are distinguished by gross human rights violation and ethnic cleansing. The second challenge concerns the quest for durable peace. Several contemporary conflicts tend to resist negotiated settlement. Yet, the ones that do reach a peace agreement still have a poor track record on implementation. The third challenge relates to the quest for effective strategies, particularly concerning the involvement of international actors in peacebuilding. JAD-PbP is convinced that the only way to address these challenges is through an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights in peace and conflict research, international law, political science and international relations. JAD-PbP has four core scientific objectives: (1) Enhance theoretical and methodological conceptualisation of just and durable peace (2) Analyse legal and democratic accountability of peacebuilding strategies, including mapping international law and norms on the use of force for humanitarian reasons. (3) Examine the effectiveness of general peacebuilding strategies and evaluate to what extent they enhance just and durable peace  (4) Examine and compare EU:s peacebuilding strategies in Western Balkans and the Middle East", 139478.0, 1497760.0, "JAD-PBP", "A fairer vision for peace", "Peace cannot come at any cost and must integrate the concept of justice if there is to be long-lasting stability.

The EU-funded project 'Just and durable peace by piece' (JAD-PBP) aimed to bridge peace and justice in order to create a durable kind of peace in war-torn societies.\n\nTo achieve its aims the project worked on enhancing theories and methodologies in building peace. It analysed legal and democratic accountability of peace-building strategies, outlining existing international norms on the use of force by states for humanitarian reasons. This also involved assessing the legal and democratic accountability of states and international organisations in post-conflict peace-building as well as redefining the concept of jus post bellum, or 'law after war'.\n\nThe project developed an analytical and methodological framework for evaluating and comparing the EU's peace-building strategies. Overall, JAD-PBP improved ways to study durable peace, focusing on just peace as being qualitatively different from the notion of positive peace since it makes no universal claims. The project integrated concepts of international\u2013local dynamics, reconciliation and amnesty provisions in peace agreements into the equation.\n\nAnother important project achievement involved the identification of best practices, mechanisms and strategies to promote peace in line with demands for accountability and human rights protection. In this respect, JAD-PBP also assessed how the concepts of Demobilisation, Demilitarisation and Reintegration (DDR) and Security Sector Reforms (SSR) were combined with peace negotiations.

The consequences of high unemployment are not mere economic, but Europe also risks a 'lost generation' of young people that, because they cannot participate in society, deals with low self-esteem, low motivation and even radicalization of thoughts and cynicism. It is a threat to the personal development of these young people as well as society and Europe as a whole.\r\n \r\nChampions Factory LTD develops the project \"Youth Leadership Academy\" (YLA), because we believe that it is important for young people \u2013 as well as for the future of Europe - to be inspired to learn, to develop their talents, skills and attitudes towards themselves and towards society.

Thus, one of the key priorities of the European Union in this regard is the promotion of Health Enhancing Physical Activity (HEPA) recommendations which is the first-ever Council recommendations in the field of sport. \u2028Walking, cycling, dancing and other regular physical activities have significant benefits for health.

We chose Varna, as it is European Youth Capital 2017 and it will significantly contribute to reach the project objectives.\r\n\r\nThe setting for the project is an outdoor setting, as we believe that an outdoor environment and physical activities are very suitable to reach the project objectives as an informal learning environment. The methodology of the youth exchanges is based on non-formal education which involves Education Through Sport. ETS is a method of developing key competences in various aspects of life using sport and physical activities. Project coordinators are experienced users of ETS as they have already implemented youth-sport projects based on this learning approach. Sport and outdoor activities will be used as a tool to raise awareness on health related issues, the importance of mutual trust, respect, tolerance and teamwork. The program of the activities involves various sport activities, workshops, informal presentations based on the active participation of young people. Participants will be actively involved to the realisation of activities and they will be encouraged to contribute with their own knowledge.\r\n\r\nWe expect to reach a long range of tangible and intangible results, as some of the main ones are:\r\nMore knowledgable 80 Young people involved in International youth mobility\r\ndeveloped capacity of organisations\r\n2 digital toolboxes with sport-based workshops, created by the participants\r\nA video of 20 participants from the both activities, sharing their with feedback\r\nProject logo\r\n2 videos of each project activity\r\n5 ideas for future projects/innitiatives together or with other partners, expanding our network\r\netc.\r\n\r\nOn the long term \u201cTogether for active lifestyle\u201d will have a positive impact on the participants, the involved organizations, the local communities and the European Union. t is expected that the young people involved in the project will become more conscious of the importance of daily physical exercise and as a result they will become more active European citizens.

With this Youth Mobility project we would like to show that sport can also be a great bridge between cultures. Using different sport disciplines we intend to bring together people of different ethnicities, languages and various nationalities. In sport, the physical involvement of young people for the common goal will teach them team-work, appreciation of others and mutual respect. It is important to exercise sport according to the rules of fair play, which also should be applied in personal and professional life.\r\n\r\nFirst activity is an 8 days Youth Exchange, which is a gathering of 20 young participants aged 17-26 years old and 5 group leaders from 5 countries (United Kingdom, Poland, Spain, Bulgaria and Lithuania) in Kent county, where we will organise team based soccer training activities, where the participants can learn the value of team work, cooperation and communication, but also together brainstorm to how to make the multicultural Europe more integrated. As a result, the participants in between the events will gain more knowledge in these issues, which will help them engage more in the latter Polish activity.\r\n\r\nSecond activity will take place in the Polish mountain town of Poronin between 2ns and 11th January 2018 and it will bring together 35 participants - 7 per country (including 1 leader). It will include a number of workshops aiming to discuss the topic of cultural differences and current European problems, and together we will try to find solutions to those issues. This will trigger interest in participants to follow more closely the current social-political situation.

Today\u2019s world is marked by widespread focus on economic development, technological advancement and global integration. Yet, we still witness widespread unemployment, especially among young people who are left outside the prosperity loop and who find it more and more difficult to access ever-changing labor markets.\r\n\r\nThe challenge of unemployment is even more sever among youth with fewer opportunities in rural and urban areas, where there is a  lack of education and opportunity. Employability and being able to make your decent living is directly related to life fulfillment and personal independence. Young people in the vicious cycle of unemployment suffer from frustration, depression, low self-esteem and even aggression and cynicism.\r\n\r\nWe believe that long term solution of this problem lies not in externalities of macro-economics or policy but in hearts and minds of young people. A renewed mindset is needed for young people to understand that even in the most difficult situations they have more control over their lives than they think and through entrepreneurial spirit, procactivity, creativity and strategic approach they can spot values, seize opportunities, assess and take calculated risks and grow. Instead of seeking a job, they can create one for themselves.\r\n\r\nOverall aims & Objectives:\r\nThe main aim of this two-stage Youth Exchange is to create a platform and a process where 42 young people experience empowerment themselves and are equipped to empower others in their communities through exchange of ideas, stories, attitudes, techniques and tools that promote entrepreneurial spirit and skills of young people in general and young people with fewer opportunities in rural and urban areas in particular.\r\n\r\nOne journey: 2 stages!\r\nThe first stage will take place in Bulgaria, where participants will explore the subject, its challenges and opportunities. In between the first and the second stage participants will do research and observation in their local communities to find useful insights and opportunities for value creation, entrepreneurship and employability. The second stage of the exchange project, which will take place in Hungary will gather insights, learning, inspirations and experience of participants from their local communities and translate them into concrete business ideas and quality youth projects to be carried out under Erasmus + Programme.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the first exchange:\r\n- Explore the concept of unemployment and achieve a common understanding of youth employability.\r\n- Analyze the current situation of young people today, especially the youth with fewer opportunities in rural and urban areas and understand their hopes, dreams fears and barriers for their personal development.\r\n- Exploring obstacles and barriers to youth employability and ways to overcome them.\r\n- Identify innovative tools and best practices and methods which can be transferred to working reality\r\n- Form teams from participants to do research and observation in their local communities after they return in order to find useful insights and opportunities for value creation, entrepreneurship and employability.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the second exchange:\r\n\r\n- Gather insights, learning, inspirations and experience of participants from their local communities and translate them into concrete project ideas.\r\n- Equip participants with knowledge and skills in the field of project management in order to enable them to develop quality youth projects.\r\n- Identify existing resources for the young entrepreneurs and share know how on social enterprises to link youth with business and entrepreneurship.\r\n- Promote Erasmus + Programme and explain how young people can be involved in it.\r\n- Develop concrete business ideas and entrepreneurial initiatives.\r\n- Develop concrete projects to be applied under Erasmus + Programme.\r\n- Develop and publish an online catalogue of business ideas.\r\n\r\nThe project activities are based on non-formal learning methods and principles, inter-cultural dialogue and communication in including group discussions, interactive presentations, participants' lead workshops, team work, etc. Youthpass tool will be used throughout the project to help young people reflect regularly on their personal learning journeys and become more aware of their own learning The methodology of the project will stimulate active participation and sense of initiative and involvement of the learners.", null, "CHAMPIONS FACTORY LTD", "erasmus_2017-2-UK01-KA105-037068_coordinator"], ["2RD", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF EAST LONDON", 22233.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.uel.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF EAST LONDON", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-036136_coordinator"], ["3TY", "\u0397 \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c9\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03ae \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ce\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03be\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c1\u03b9\u03b6\u03bf\u03c3\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2", "CHAMPIONS FACTORY LTD", 12819.0, "It is certain that the current economic crisis is intertwined with the social fabric, thereby intensifying the humanitarian crisis and driving groups and young people into violent extremism-fanaticism, which are now one of the greatest dangers in E .

The methodology of the youth exchanges is based on non-formal education which involves Education Through Sport. ETS is a method of developing key competences in various aspects of life using sport and physical activities. Project coordinators are experienced users of ETS as they have already implemented youth-sport projects based on this learning approach. Sport and outdoor activities will be used as a tool to raise awareness on health-related issues, the importance of mutual trust, respect, tolerance and teamwork. The program of the activities involves various sport activities, workshops, informal presentations based on the active participation of young people. Participants will be actively involved to the realisation of activities and they will be encouraged to contribute with their own knowledge.\r\n\r\nWe expect to reach a long range of tangible and intangible results, as some of the main ones are:\r\n- More knowledgable 120 Young people involved in International youth mobility\r\n- Digital toolboxes with sport-based activities, created by the participants\r\n- developed capacity of organisations\r\n- 3 videos from each activity with moments form the workshops \r\n- video interview of 10 participants from each activity, sharing their with feedback\r\n- project logo\r\n- 6 ideas for future projects/initiatives together or with other partners, expanding our network\r\netc.\r\n\r\nOn the long term the project will have a positive impact on the participants, the involved organizations, the local communities and the European Union.
