By employing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to liquefy and store cryogens, CryoHub will balance the power grid, while meeting the cooling demand of a refrigerated food warehouse and recovering the waste heat from its equipment and components.\nThe intermittent supply is a major obstacle to the RES power market. In reality, RES are fickle forces, prone to over-producing when demand is low and failing to meet requirements when demand peaks. Europe is about to generate 20% of its required energy from RES by 2020, so that the proper RES integration poses continent-wide challenges.\nThe Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES), and particularly the Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), is a promising technology enabling on-site storage of RES energy during periods of high generation and its use at peak grid demand. Thus, CES acts as Grid Energy Storage (GES), where cryogen is boiled to drive a turbine and to restore electricity to the grid. To date, CES applications have been rather limited by the poor round trip efficiency (ratio between energies spent for and retrieved from energy storage) due to unrecovered energy losses.\nThe CryoHub project is therefore designed to maximise the CES efficiency by recovering energy from cooling and heating in a perfect RES-driven cycle of cryogen liquefaction, storage, distribution and efficient use. Refrigerated warehouses for chilled and frozen food commodities are large electricity consumers, possess powerful installed capacities for cooling and heating and waste substantial amounts of heat.

This can be seen, for example, in the understanding of 'gender' as simply concerned with the numerical representation of the two sexes in most quantitative analyses. This not only factors out the gendered hierarchies and social processes that condition science in general and work group dynamics in particular, but severely hampers systematic comparisons of research performance impacts. Using innovative methods for the analysis of the diversity-research productivity relationship, Gedii will develop a reliable diversity measure that is sensitive to power, status and information sharing differentials within teams and across public & private organisations.

GDI scores will be explored in relation to a flexible set of performance indicators, including patent and bibliometric measures, combined with new indicators of social impact. Gedii's evaluation framework thus responds to the growing concern with responsible research and innovation.

This novel coating will be able to contribute to the stiffness and rigidity of an elastic metallic structure, to withstand the expected loading conditions safely, to enhance the integrity of a damaged structure and at the same time to protect it from corrosion. Such coating can bring multiple breakthroughs from the design level to the maintenance and repair level of the structure. The innovative compounds of the proposed coating are elements of smart materials - Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs). SMA elements are designed materials that have one or more properties that can be significantly changed in a controlled fashion by external stimuli. They can sense temperatures or stress as a function of change in damping, stiffness, electrical resistivity and deflection. It is specifically the latter aspect, which makes SMAs highly interesting for the particular application, since it is the actuation function built into the material. The innovative concept of the coating is described briefly as follows: upon mechanical loading the structure and hence the coating are deformed together as a system. However, by heating the coating, the SMA elements tend to recover their experienced deformations and return to their original shape. At this point, shear forces will be developed to the interface between coating and structure. The developed shear forces are expected to mitigate the deformation of the structure and reduce the level of the stress field. The latter is a great benefit for the regions, where cracks exist, since the local reduction of the stress field will delay the crack propagation and hence the structural failure.
