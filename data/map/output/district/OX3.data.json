The life science industry has come to realise the trends and potential of miniaturisation which already have effected the information and communication industry in the last decades. Combinations of microfluidics, microelectronics and microoptics provide striking opportunities for advancing biomedical research and creating new markets for the medical sciences industry. In terms of economical and ecologically worthwhile processes, complex Micro-Nano Bio Systems (MNBS) have greatest potential to enhance processes for cell-based assays, chemical analytics and medical diagnostics.However, there are three main challenges for such (MNBS) market to overcome which hamper growth of the market: First, a lack of economical micro-fabrication methods hamper the implementation of lab-on-chip solutions in an industrial scale. Second, inefficient interfaces between laboratory equipment and mircofluidic devices cause a lack of interoperability. Third, there is no integrated manufacturing platform which provides flexible and cheap design and re-design opportunities.<br/>ML\u00b2 will overcome these three main challenges by developing a cost efficient production system for new generation MNBS, combining microfluidics, optics and microelectronics. The devices will base on a multi layer concept. The overall function of the smart device will be split in several subfunctions, which can be of fluidic, optical or electronic nature. Multiple foils will transfer the functionality into technical solutions.

Together with member states, the FP7 infrastructure unit supports the preparation and operation of a pan-European infrastructure for clinical trials (ECRIN).

They want to show that their life is interesting, how they live, what they do, share what they discover and also share their experiences with a wider community than just that which is in their immediate geographical location.  These positive feelings help young people to make good friends and build relationships and feel good about themselves.  Social media are free to use and are utilised by young people as a communication tool to keep in contact with people all over the world. They inform friends about their lives, share information and arrange events or meetings.  Twitter may even be used to publicise events and buy tickets, Instagram used to communicate through images and facebook for longer and deeper conversations and even relationships.  Young people are able to identify like-minded people by looking at their lifestyle and comments on social media.  Young people are creating groups on social media to connect people from different countries, backgrounds and cultures and promote inclusion.  Young people are more likely to be informed about world events through social media rather than watching traditional news media. Young people are exposed to many different and varied opinions.  Opinions are formed by talking directly to the people who may be involved in a news story rather than receiving the information second-hand.  Social media has the effect of reducing tensions in society and increasing understanding of different cultures thereby reducing the barriers between people and creating inclusion and strengthening communities.\r\nNICE 2 TALK intends to be the final  outcome of the iknowledge and understanding we gained in two previous projects looking at media, communications and communities with Kyu Shin Kan, and to build on our ongoing relationship with Hayashi from Germany who work in the same disability field as the Disability Karate Federation.

Ultimately they will explore the need to create a framework for a course of self-defense and empowerment which they themselves may go on to teach.\r\n\r\nAggression can take many forms.  Martial arts and self-defense are not just a physical response to violent aggression.  Self-defence is firstly about not putting yourself in danger and always being prepared.  Self-defense is the realisation of what constitutes an attack and that physical aggression is often an escalated level of attack that began with a verbal confrontation or some imagined slight.  Self-defence is about defusing those situations before they have had time to escalate.  A physical response is the last line of defence.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, studies have shown that by being physically active, and the strength and stamina that is developed, some conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity, depression and high blood pressure can be eliminated or reduced.  The stronger sense of values and identity that is developed through martial arts can help disadvantaged women and girls to maintain a higher level of independence which increases self-esteem and self-confidence which can lead to education and employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nEVA FEM will create resilience for young women who have had significant life events so that they gain the ability to react and adapt positively to difficult and challenging events and experiences and bounce back from them in a positive way  \r\n\r\nEVA-FEM will show that sport can change the lives of young women from different disadvantaged backgrounds in Europe and beyond to get them more involved and integrated into society and also make them happier and more motivated.\r\n\r\nTo address these issues three youth exchanges will be organized involving self-defense, sports and outdoor activities.
