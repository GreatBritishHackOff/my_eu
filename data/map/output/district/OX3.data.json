The life science industry has come to realise the trends and potential of miniaturisation which already have effected the information and communication industry in the last decades. Combinations of microfluidics, microelectronics and microoptics provide striking opportunities for advancing biomedical research and creating new markets for the medical sciences industry. In terms of economical and ecologically worthwhile processes, complex Micro-Nano Bio Systems (MNBS) have greatest potential to enhance processes for cell-based assays, chemical analytics and medical diagnostics.However, there are three main challenges for such (MNBS) market to overcome which hamper growth of the market: First, a lack of economical micro-fabrication methods hamper the implementation of lab-on-chip solutions in an industrial scale. Second, inefficient interfaces between laboratory equipment and mircofluidic devices cause a lack of interoperability. Third, there is no integrated manufacturing platform which provides flexible and cheap design and re-design opportunities.<br/>ML\u00b2 will overcome these three main challenges by developing a cost efficient production system for new generation MNBS, combining microfluidics, optics and microelectronics. The devices will base on a multi layer concept. The overall function of the smart device will be split in several subfunctions, which can be of fluidic, optical or electronic nature. Multiple foils will transfer the functionality into technical solutions. Economic roll-to-roll processes will be developed for the production of micro fluidic and optic functional layers.ML\u00b2 will provide a design and manufacturing platform for the production of sophisticated devices which combine microfluidics, optics and microelectronics.

Together with member states, the FP7 infrastructure unit supports the preparation and operation of a pan-European infrastructure for clinical trials (ECRIN). Through these instruments, Europe has the capacity to design and conduct independent, multinational clinical trials.\nThe objective of the ECRAN project is to develop tools to communicate key messages to citizens, patients, healthcare professionals, researchers, policymakers and society about independent, multinational clinical research. These messages will focus on:\ni) \tthe importance of public understanding of the need for and basic principles of clinical trials, fostering active involvement of patients in trials and of their representatives in trial design;\nii) \tthe need for independent clinical trials driven by healthcare issues, to optimise treatment strategies through comparison of benefits and harms of multiple therapeutic options, supporting evidence-based clinical practice and reduction in healthcare inequalities;\niii) \tthe need for transparency and optimal use of data, to promote the cost-effectiveness of treatments and to reduce the economic burden of diseases;\niv) \tthe need for multinational cooperation, taking advantage of Europe\u2019s population size and diversity, and of its medical expertise.\nThese objectives will be addressed using communication tools, including: a website, with an online database of open educational resources in different European languages; a film on clinical trials, dubbed in many languages, which is envisaged as a keystone of this initiative; an international event on multinational clinical trials.", 18070.0, 805656.0, "ECRAN", "Increasing healthcare research awareness", "An online resource for the latest advances in medical research will empower Europeans to make better choices about their health, providing them with opportunities to participate in clinical trials.", "More and more people are using the Internet to learn about the latest clinical trials in health care research. If exploited correctly, valid health research could improve the safety and effectiveness of health care while diminishing costs. The EU-funded project 'European communication on research awareness needs' (http://www.ecranproject.eu (ECRAN)) is highlighting the importance of public understanding of clinical trials, independent clinical research and multinational collaboration.\n\nThe project is increasing awareness of the pros and cons of clinical trials by targeting EU citizens. The different subgroups included are current and future patients, health care professionals, relevant policymakers, politicians, research ethics committees, scientists, teachers, journalists as well as school students. Factors such as the uncertainty as well as chances for receiving the treatments (randomisation) and independence in clinical research were covered using different communication tools.\n\nCommunication tools such as animated films, publications and events, in addition to a website that has already been launched were used. ECRAN is collecting and cataloguing communication materials and tools under one searchable online database. Project work also includes a tool to assess and apply metadata to the material collected in the online database, as well as collaboration with science journalists to disseminate messages globally.\n\nOverall, ECRAN will provide credible and reliable information about clinical research. This should increase awareness in the field as well as promote the participation of European citizens in clinical trials. The material \u2014 which will be available on the project website under creative commons license \u2014 is being developed in a simple, non-technical and readable manner for all target users.\n\nThe information will be available in English, French, German, Italian, Polish and Spanish to reach at least three fourths of Europe's citizens, the animated film is dubbed in all the 23 official European languages.

EuroGentest2 will be concerned with setting the targets for laboratory and health professional accreditation, by contributing to guidelines and standards, and actively interacting with the professional organizations and the policy makers. EuroGentest2 will also assist the diagnostic and clinical community and the individual laboratories and counselling units in reaching those aims by providing tools for quality management and by coordinating training activities. EuroGentest2 will extend its activities from postnatal diagnostic and predictive testing to prenatal testing, thereby building on the achievements of the FP6 SAFE network, and to direct to consumer testing.\nA major aim of the Coordination Action will be the creation of a European association of genetic diagnostic centres that will guarantee the future of the network.\nThe Coordination Action will lead to the further harmonization and quality assurance of genetic practice. The patients will benefit by the improvement of the analytical and clinical quality and validity of the testing, and from improved trans-border services and information. The European diagnostics industry will benefit through a faster access of innovations to the market through the validation for diagnostic use.

An EQA common template for genotyping and interpretation was developed and data is available on the Orphanet portal. Online registration is also an option for participation. Researchers developed six pilot schemes based on an EQA for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD).\n\nProject members were instrumental in producing reference materials for molecular pathology EQA schemes through collaboration with the European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN) and others. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reference material for Huntington's disease was used to develop an EQA for calibrating assays for this disease. EUROGENTEST2 researchers prepared draft guidelines on new genetic services such as NGS, informed consent, genetic counselling for pre-symptomatic testing and prenatal diagnosis. Review papers on DTC have also been written for publication.\n\nProject members developed documents called clinical utility gene cards (CUGCs) for assessing genetic diagnostic tests for clinical utility and good practices information. They have successfully published 57 CUGCs. New CUGCs will be published in the EUROGENTEST newsletter and permanently implemented on the Orphanet rare disease portal.\n\nA postgraduate master course has been set up on the topic of quality in health care in collaboration with other major universities. Professionals can attain certification through the 'Quality Improvement Sciences in Healthcare. Improving clinical practice; an evidence based course'.\n\nEUROGENTEST2 members were also actively involved in the revision of the ISO 15189 standard and in the modification of the in vitro diagnostic\u00a0(IVD) regulation. This work will not only assist policymakers but also ensure that the needs of health professionals with regard to European guidelines and regulations are met.\n\nSuccessful project outcomes will improve access to pilot EQA schemes for better quality management and reference materials for rare diseases.
