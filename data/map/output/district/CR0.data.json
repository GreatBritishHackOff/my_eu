This project has a core focus to engage young people in positive activity, through the youth exchange. These young people will be marginalised and often feel dis-enfranchised within their community. There has been an increasing amount of academic and policy literature devoted to the importance of the arts and culture to the well-being, personal growth and social development of the individual within civil society. There has also been an ever-growing body of academic literature attesting to the blurring of boundaries between audience and spectator, professional and amateur arts and continuing debates as to the role of the artist and authorship and to the nature and future of what is termed \u2018art\u2019 today. However, very little has been explored concerning the effect of grassroots arts activities, and by this, we mean here amateur arts activities, on the individual and on the communities within which the activities take place. \r\n\r\nProblems to address: Marginalised young people with limited opportunities to understand the digital world in which they live in Poor use of resources and digital media Not feeling motivated or aspiration Low self-awareness and self-knowledge Loss of value, identity and self-esteem Low confidence in potential and social abilities Low employability perspectives and no sense of moral obligation \r\n\r\nAim - To stimulate the creative mindset of all young people so they can feel confident in communicating and socialising with others in their community.
