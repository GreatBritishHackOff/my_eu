This bacterium resides in the intestinal tracts ofinfected hosts and is transmitted from the faeces of people and animals. Salmonellosis is one of the most common enteric (intestinal) infections and is the second most common food borne illness. There are several types of strains, but two of them, Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium, are responsible for half of all human infections. Once in the egg, Salmonella is very resistant. A person infected with the Salmonella enteritidis bacterium begins to show symptoms of infection 12 to 72 hours after consuming contaminated food - with infection lasting 4 to 7 days. While most persons recover with or without antibiotic treatment, diarrhoea can be sufficiently severe to require hospitalisation. The elderly, infants, pregnant women and those with impaired immune systems are more at risk with the potential of infections spreading from the intestines to the blood stream and to other body parts and ultimately threatening the life of the infected individual.\nThe main objective of the OVOSHINE project is to develop a low cost, secure and fast UV system in combination with hot air to sterilise eggs.\nThe proposed technology provides the following advantages:\n\u2022 Unlike other treatments, the OVOSHINE system does not increase the temperature of the egg.\n\u2022 The entire egg shell will be illuminated by highly energetic UV photons that will eliminate the bacteria.\n\u2022 No chemical products will be used, thus eliminating egg contamination.\n\u2022 A continuous sterilisation system will be used, to be inserted in the production or packing line, facilitating the installation in existing modern production lines.\n\u2022 The disinfection process is both fast and of low cost, amounting to a very small contribution to the total egg cost.", 415835.0, 2161706.0, "OVOSHINE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.darouv.co.uk", null, "fp7_188528_947652074"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9QZ", "Poissons de mer, poissons de rivi\u00e8re: la consommation de poisson en Europe", "The Great House Hotel and Restaurant", 11579.0, "In order to train cooks and waiters able to work in famous restaurants with clients from all over the world, we wish to perpetuate the rewarding former placements within the establishments of our European partners. This is the reason why we would like to continue working in close collaboration with our old partners from the Catering Department of Gerona High School, the Marina Restaurant Ltd, Malta, the Catering Section of Rybnik Technical School in Poland and the Catering Section of Elizabeth Selbert-Schule in Hameln, Germany. Furthermore, we wish to confirm our recent collaboration with the Great House Hotel in Lavenham, England.\r\nOur policy is based on two main principles:\r\n- First we wish to perpetuate the existing placement opportunities and develop our list of restaurant partners. We also suggest restaurant placements adapted to the levels and requirements of the Spanish, Polish, German students.\r\n- Second, we will plan our cultural and gastronomic exchanges \u2013 with a presentation of fishes from these European countries and regions \u2013 so that our students can reuse some of the knowledge they have studied at school.\r\nThe 20 chosen participants will be placed in restaurants for four weeks in September 2018 with a possible seasonal job before, that is in July and August. The length of this period is in agreement with the diploma (Baccalaur\u00e9at) reference text. It also enables the students to take full advantage of the placements as they adapt and integrate within the company, work and reuse their knowledge and at last through the assessment of their training period.\r\n \r\nEach participant will have to discover the products from the host country especially the fishes: The anchovies of Escala in Catalonia, the maltese mackerel lampuki, the smoked fishes of the Baltic Sea as the herring and the eel in Germany,  the polish herring and the english fish and chips, scampies and fishcakes. An interesting point for our trainees will be to discover how the foreign chefs use these products in their own cuisine and possibly how to promote our local products. Furthermore, equipments, instructions, health and safety standards are different from one country to another. When our students come back from their work experience abroad they will know a lot more and they will be able to use this knowledge in their future job and restaurants.\r\nWe prepare a training placement program together with our partners. We have learnt from the former placements abroad that the supervision by French teachers in the very first days is absolutely necessary. Our students are usually welcomed in the partner school the first day. Our project points to a short stay of the French teacher(s) to make sure that the students can get along on their own. Our students are monitored by local teachers all along their training period. At the end of the students\u2019 stay French teachers go and visit the restaurant and local partner for students\u2019 assessments\r\n\r\nWe await several results for our students after a mobility experience:\r\n- A better language use on a professional, cultural and more common level,\r\n- Develop their general and vocational knowledge\r\n- Improve their knowledge on European fats and the use of these in the catering industry\r\n- Give the students more chances to pass their final exam\r\n- Deliver a EUROPASS to the students so they can attest their training experience abroad and get a job in the EC.\r\nFor our partners it is also important to:\r\n- Have a better knowledge of our School System and vocational organizations\r\n- Increase the number of beneficiary students up to 20.\r\nOn a short term we also plan to use these European student exchanges as a showcase for our school by issuing these on our web portal (ENT) and present these on the Open School Day as well as on the various catering meetings \u2013 either business or with other institutions- that we attend every year.", "http://www.greathouse.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036161_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CO10"}
