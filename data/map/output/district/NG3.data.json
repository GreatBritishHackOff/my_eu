One of the key production processes in high labour cost areas such as Europe is assembly of final products in sectors such as automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical and medical industries. They all require systems that can: be installed quickly, achieve high volumes at shorter time intervals, perform with minimum interruptions and be reconfigured for new products with minimum cost.\nPRIME aims to create new solutions for deployment by SMEs of highly adaptive, reconfigurable self-aware plug and produce assembly systems, which will use multi-agent control, dynamic knowledge sharing, integrated monitoring, and innovative human-machine interaction mechanisms. These next generation assembly systems equipped with PRIME technology will be able to proactively support rapid reconfiguration, adaptation, error-recovery, and operational performance improvement. This will lead to a dramatic cost and time reduction of deploying and maintaining complex assembly systems on demand and improve their effectiveness.\nThe PRIME vision will be achieved by enhancing today\u2019s assembly systems with standardised plug and produce process and control solutions and interfaces to allow rapid reconfiguration and deployment, performance monitoring, self-awareness and evolutionary system adaptation. Based on this, the overall system performance will be monitored against production objectives and bottlenecks, thus errors and sub-optimal behaviour can be identified and assigned to the responsible stations. This will enable optimisation and adaptation of the assembly processes and associated system behaviour within a human centred environment. Furthermore, methods will be developed to integrate existing legacy system modules within the plug-and-produce environment using standardised interfacing.", 296194.0, 4331495.0, "PRIME", "Streamlining assembly processes", "The assembly of automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical and medical industries is intertwined with high labour costs in Europe.

The EU-funded project 'Plug and produce intelligent multi agent environment based on standard technology' (http://www.prime-eu.com/ (PRIME)) is developing a new multi-agent architecture using plug-and-produce principles for configuring production systems through innovative human-machine interaction (HMI) mechanisms.\n\nPRIME is enhancing current assembly systems with standardised process and control solutions and interfaces to allow rapid reconfiguration and deployment. These next-generation assembly systems are based on self-awareness and self-adaptation that are made possible through computerised systems \u2014 multi-agents \u2014 dynamic knowledge sharing and integrated monitoring. Furthermore, they will be able to proactively support error recovery and operational performance improvement.\n\nThe overall system performance will be monitored against production objectives and bottlenecks, enabling optimisation and adaptation of assembly processes. Standardised interfaces are making integration of legacy process system modules easier.\n\nTo date, project members have analysed the industrial requirements of plug-and-produce assembly systems and defined the PRIME architecture. Focus has been placed on developing a semantic model that describes the entire system and a multi-agent data model that supports the correct operation of PRIME.\n\nThe team has also developed a configuration approach to plug-and-produce assembly systems. Work was geared towards designing and implementing the communication and control infrastructure and testing HMI components. Another task was to enable the PRIME system to proactively select new behaviours and agents to deal with the dynamism introduced by interacting with the real world. To this end, the team is introducing self-awareness, the capacity to self-adapt and the ability to assess its own performance.\n\nThree demonstrators will illustrate how PRIME can find application to real industrial situations. The focus will be on verifying, validating and demonstrating the methods developed, and supporting the refinement of the innovative developments through continued assessment and evaluation.\n\nPRIME's breakthrough system will have a major impact on European companies. It should significantly reduce the installation costs and enhance market responsiveness of assembly lines by reducing the reconfiguration time, cost and effort.", null, "http://www.tqc.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/157332.jpg", "fp7_104470_994398023"], ["2NJ", "Tests for leakage identification on Aircraft fluid Mechanical Installations", "Tqc Limited", "The project aims to develop innovative methods to make on-ground leak testing more efficient, ecological and faster in aeronautical industry environments, reducing costs, time to market and toxic wastes due to standardization on test procedures and testing using non-polluting means.  \n\nThe project will draw on TQC's in-depth knowledge of leak testing techniques, our wide experience of fluid mechanics and applied sealing systems that have been used to test aircraft fuel tanks, fuel transfer systems, aircraft hydraulics, fire extinguisher systems and leading edge ducts on the latest aircraft structures that use modern materials.\n\nRecently TQC has constructed complete sophisticated PC based control systems for leak testing fully constructed wings using a) tracer gas (Helium and Hydrogen) techniques for fuel tanks and fuel transfer systems, b) complete wing hydraulic testers for flushing at a Re No. 4,500 with particle size monitoring and then pressure testing to 4,500 psi using Skydrol, and c) testing lower pressure systems for leading edge duct, gas inerting and for fire extinguisher systems using pressure decay techniques.\n\nTQC has a significant portfolio of leak testing projects in a range of industries including aerospace, automotive, nuclear, medical device, pharmaceuticals and renewable energies.

People who are affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other dementias often face cognitive, behavioural and psychosocial difficulties, including impairment and degeneration of memory and of perceptions of identity. In a social context, this can cause difficulties of recognizing, relating to and empathising with other people. These difficulties often pose a challenge for engaging socially, reinforcing their effects and reducing personal well-being. \n\nDesign can offer novel ways of complementing existing care approaches to empower people with dementia in everyday social situations. Utilising the concept of mindful design, we will investigate innovative design solutions to enable self-empowerment and confidence building of people living with dementia. We will specifically focus on two areas: personal difficulties with social interaction and environmental influences on social engagement. In these two contexts, we will study how personal, wearable designs can help mediate perceptions of identity and emotion management; and how environmental aspects can reduce feelings of information overload and instill feelings of self-empowerment and control.\n\nThe outcomes and benefits of the project will include: the development of new uses of design for helping people with dementia to engage socially and improve subjective well-being; the presentation of a robust methodological co-design framework for the development and evaluation of the designs in dementia care settings; the development of a holistic mindful model of designing and of a model for mindful care for social engagement for people with dementia; policy recommendations for the inclusion of design within dementia care.\n\nThis groundbreaking project will be enabled through an innovative consortium of academic and non-academic partners that combines research in product and environmental design, ICT, and dementia care.", 31054.0, 461934.0, "MinD", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_199934_933907465"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NG3"}
