Improved insights will result from the analysis of large amount of data, acquired from different sources and sectors, and in multiple languages. The integration of consumer and market data collected by different business partners will ensure to cover customer interactions and activities across different channels, providing insights on rich customer journeys. These integrated data will be further enriched with information about weather and events, two crucial factors impacting on consumer choices. By disruptively increasing the analytical power coming from the integration of cross-sectorial and cross-language data sources and new data sources companies will deploy real-time responsive services for digital marketing, reporting-style services for market research, and advanced data and resource management services for Retail & eCommerce and their technology providers. \nAs of today, developing these services is too costly or nearly impossible for a large number of European companies. Even when these companies have developed excellent skills in analyzing data in their sector, they lack knowledge, technology and resources that are needed to integrate and analyze large and divers data in a timely manner. Enriching business data with weather data is difficult and costly. Using event data to obtain precise customer and market insights is even more challenging because of the difficulty of collecting and accessing data about events at a large scale. Language barriers, lack of agreed models and shared systems of identifiers to interlink data make these data integration tasks even only more challenging.", 297140.0, 3113259.0, "EW-Shopp", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_207028_919668738"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0EH", "State Machines - Art, Work, and Identity in an Age of Planetary-Scale Computation", "FURTHERFIELD.ORG", 175382.0, "Today, we live in a world where every time we turn on our smartphones, we are inextricably tied by data, laws and flowing bytes to different countries, in which every personal expression is framed and mediated by digital platforms, and where new kinds of currencies, financial exchange and even labour bypass corporations and governments.

ADICE considers the mobility as a tool allowing the development of technical, transverse and social skills favoring the access to the market of the employment. Furthermore, the labor pool of the Lille metropolis, and Roubaix-Tourcoing in particular, is characterized by a strong unemployment rate and by an existence of districts enclosed socially and economically, what underlines the relevance of the activities of the ADICE and this project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project \"European Mobility: Key Opportunity for a New Generation\" is planned for two years, from the 1st of July 2014, the sending of 60 learners in vocational training, in mobility for purposes of learning, in the eligible countries of the European Union: in United Kingdom, in Malta, in Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Austria, Germany, Spain, Poland and Greece.\r\n\r\nThe mobility project will be internship in an enterprise or in a non-profit organization for 3 months, 6 months or 10 months. \r\n\r\nThe project plans also 5 projects of mobility for the staffs of the vocational training, for the activities of education and training in Spain, in United Kingdom and in Italy for durations of one week and two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this project, ADICE will accompany people in vocational training (or having obtained their diploma there is less than year) as well as members of their staff. Furthermore, ADICE is in the course of request of accreditation of training institution with the prefecture of the North, what should be granted during year 2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessional internship will be organized and defined according the experience, the sector of activity, the professional project, the needs, the expectations in short and long term and the profile of the participants. Indeed, ADICE\u2019s goals are to promote the European mobility, to fight against discriminations and to promote people with fewer opportunities at a social and professional level. Our public is diverse and our projects are open for all learners of the region, without any discrimination, any level of studies is required or limited age, the destination, duration, various sectors of activity, but are more characterized by the objectives and profile of each person. Applications are thus estimated with regard to all these criteria and on the coherence of the project of the person. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the level of the European partners, we work on one hand with intermediate structures asked to organize the mobility of the participants, and it to supply an on-the-spot support and a necessary frame for the participants having more difficulties. On the other hand, we work also more and more with direct  structure, selected specially for a project or having already welcomed our participants within their structures.\r\n\r\nOur partners' network is characterized by a geographical, linguistic and economic diversity (Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Poland, the United Kingdom, etc.) and a plurality of activities sectors adapted to every public (social, tourism, sale, communication, etc.) and of types of structures (companies, associations) Every partner, whether it is a direct structure or intermediate structure, is in charge of supplying a quality placement (within its structure or with one of his local partners), and if possible the accommodation and the language courses (if the project is realized outside the countries where the official language is English, French, Italian, German or Spanish).
