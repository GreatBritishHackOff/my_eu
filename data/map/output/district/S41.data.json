These include enhanced thermal and chemical properties, better compatibility with cellulose fibres, greater ease of processing and higher resistance to impact.\n\nThe precursor sugar blends that were fed to the bacteria played a critical role. They were obtained from hydrolysed wheat straw as agricultural waste, both cost effective and non-competitive with food production. Optimising the combination of culture media and precursor feeds led to high yield of improved PHB.\n\nResearchers also developed economically feasible processes to yield cellulose nanowhiskers and lignin nanofibres with new functionalities from lignocellulosic wood waste. Enzymes are nature's catalysts and the team used green enzymatic processes to separate out the wood biomass components and produce nanofibres with antimicrobial, flame retardant and self-assembly properties.\n\nUsing standard extrusion and injection processes, the team successfully produced complex multi-layer parts using PHB and both types of fibres. The parts demonstrated significant improvements in mechanical properties. Demonstrator components for four different industrial case studies were produced.\n\nRising petroleum prices along with the need for sustainable alternatives to conventional plastic could ensure faster commercialisation of BUGWORKERS bio-nanocomposites.

Therefore, the partners want to arrange a YE where youth with an entrepreneurial spirit, mentored by experienced entrepreneurs, can get a hands-on experience with entrepreneurship and a CME where the partners will help each other explore tangible ideas and create concrete projects to promote youth entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to utilise the already existing entrepreneurial spirit among youth by creating an environment where young entrepreneurs can flourish and grow.\r\n\r\nThe aim will be reached through the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1. Provide an expectation-free environment where young people can be supported to develop and test their entrepreneurial ideas;\r\n2. Create concrete project proposals for promoting an entrepreneurial spirit amongst youth through utilising best practices of the partners and results of the YE;\r\n3. Offer reflections upon own and partners' potential to create visibility, dissemination, exploitation and local impact of projects.\r\n\r\nThe project will consist of the following activities:\r\n\r\nActivity A1 is a YE based upon the concept of an entrepreneurship incubator, gathering 24 young people who are highly motivated about entrepreneurship and has expressed a desire to participate actively in the exchange, as well as 6 youth leaders with at least one year's experience. The activity uses different non-formal methods to develop the skills, attitudes and knowledge of young people to develop and implement own business ideas. During the YE the participants will be mentored by experts within the field of entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nActivity A2 is a CME gathering 43 participants who are non-formal educators/youth leaders working at the partner organisations. Following visits to a local enterprises and non-formal sessions and discussions on the importance and relevance of non-formal education and the results from the YE, the participants will cooperate to create concrete proposals for promoting an entrepreneurial spirit among youth through international projects designed within the framework of the E+ Programme. Participants should further represent their organisations through presentations, organisational speed-dating and through own activities.\r\n\r\nThe partners expect that as a result of this project, the young people participating on the YE become motivated to take the necessary risks and become socially responsible entrepreneurs. Moreover, the youth leaders will gain tools and methods to motivate youth in their communities and promote an entrepreneurial spirit, and the participants on the CME will produce at least 6 concrete project proposals promoting entrepreneurship among youth that will be implemented by the participating organisations to the benefit of local youth.\r\n\r\nAlso, the CME will establish lasting partnerships between the participating organisations. The participants and the organisations they represent will be inspired by each other and introduced to new perspectives on entrepreneurship, youth, non-formal educationwhich will strengthen their capacity to promote youth entrepreneurship and reach out to young people in their local communities.\r\n\r\nThus, on the long term, this project will potentially benefit local societies in the 15 countries that the partners are located in, as they will gain more young entrepreneurs who, as active citizens will fight youth unemployment and foster development. In particular, the young people who participated on the YE and young people who will participate in future transnational projects, will also become more inclined to work across borders.", "http://www.intercollege.info", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA105-034038_5"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["7NA", "Growing and Developing the Visitor Economy Sector within Derbyshire.", "Visit Peak District and Derbyshire", "The project will support the capacity of SMEs in the visitor economy and its supply chains to grow in regional, national and international markets.
