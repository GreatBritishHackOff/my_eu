The PR 2.0 proposal addresses the need for European SMEs to take advantage of the benefits of using social media to increase their competitiveness by offering an affordable, cost-effective centralised web tool for management of marketing campaigns using popular social media tools such as social networks and microblogging platforms. In addition, PR 2.0 will allow companies large and small to easily monitor user-generated content about their business or brands, allowing them to easily manage their online reputation, be alerted to possible public relations crises and take immediate actions. A cloud computing model for the exploitation of the project results will ensure that the PR2.0 project is accessible to SMEs and a user-centered user interface will ensure that the system is in line with their skill set and needs. Opinion Mining techniques and advanced web design and development methodologies and a user-centered design perspective will be used in this project with the aim of achieving the objective of developing a novel tool in a fast-paced, ever changing environment like social media and with a potential impact not only in the PR and marketing sector but in almost any business activity. The commercialisation of the PR2.0 tool will result in economic benefits for the consortium, savings and improvement of competitiveness for the PR 2.0 users, and, by the generation of training material and guidelines, the PR2.0 will also educate on and encourage the use of Web 2.0 tools among the European SMEs.", 117821.0, 1166633.0, "PR2.0", "Social media management for SMEs", "Tracking and managing a company's online reputation requires resources many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not possess or cannot afford.

Since the advent of the internet and social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, this task has become increasingly complex.\n\nPublic relations (PR) and communication firms normally carry out the monitoring of the media profile of a given company, and create campaigns to bolster it. However, such services are often unaffordable to SMEs.\n\nUsing EU funding, the PR2.0 project set out to develop a software tool to enable SMEs to visualise and analyse data from social media, and to add intelligent analysis modules related to natural language-processing techniques.\n\nThe project members created a prototype software tool to analyse social media that adopts and adapts the latest semantic technologies and multi-agent architecture, all encased in a user-friendly interface. Among its numerous innovations, the PR2.0 technology includes an automated opinion extraction module.\n\nPR2.0's prototype tool has proven to be useful in the analysis of Twitter and Facebook posts in English. The partners explored various promising commercialisation opportunities, including distribution of the PR2.0 solution, spin-off tools for other sectors and the integration of modules into other applications.\n\nPR2.0 will have a profound impact on SMEs, enabling them to manage their own online reputations, as well as to launch, maintain and monitor social media campaigns.", null, "http://www.wearesocial.net/", "/docs/results/images/2013-09/56280.jpg", "fp7_97136_984712379"], ["1BS", "Hybrid Radio everywhere for everyone", "Uk Radioplayer Ltd", "HRADIO (Hybrid Radio everywhere for everyone) focuses on radio service innovations enabled by convergence. While radio, with its rich editorial content, remains a highly popular medium, listening figures are slowly declining, particularly among youngsters. With the rapid rise of smartphones, radio faces competition from many new services including music steaming platforms. Regular radio today often does not include attractive features as known from vertical platforms. And if present, they are mostly not well integrated with the actual radio programme. This is where HRADIO will deliver.\nDriven by the industry need to create attractive new radio experiences, the project will leverage the full potential of hybrid technology for radio \u2013 enabling the integration of cost-effective broadcast distribution with new online features. Broadcasters will be enabled to personalise radio services (while respecting privacy), to provide intuitive functionalities like time-shifting and, eventually, to foster and to exploit user engagement. HRADIO will pave the way to bring these features not only to broadcasters\u2019 native mobile applications, but also to portals, to connected radios and into the car. The core approach is to integrate validated solutions and to harmonise APIs which together will provide broadcasters with an abstracted service layer accessible across any device and distribution platform \u2013 ensuring sustainability and return of investment. Therefore, consumers will be able to access their personal radio services on different devices and platforms enabled by a seamless broadcast-internet integration for radio content distribution. All features will be tested in 3 phases of large-scale pilots involving broadcasters, app developers for mobile and automotive devices. \nEventually, HRADIO will publish its developments as ready-to-use Android and HTML client implementations including an extensive set of well documented APIs fostering new service developments for the radio sector.", 201452.0, 2849907.0, "HRadio", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_211079_916608194"], ["1HB", "Airline Maintenance Operations implementation of an E2E Maintenance Service Architecture and its enablers", "Aerospace International Services Limited", "The AIRMES project focusses on optimising end-to-end maintenance activities within an operator\u2019s environment.

By blending this knowledge based environment with mobile tools for remote support, using augmented reality technologies and two way communication solutions, the resulting service architecture will provide contextualised, updated and integrated information to all members of the maintenance value chain. \nThe impact of this project on European Air Traffic will be significant.
