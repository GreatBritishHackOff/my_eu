Continued strong growth is predicted. However, a growing problem is manifesting itself within the industry.\n\n\nThe submarine cables that are an essential infrastructural component of offshore energy now account for 80% of insurance claims related offshore renewables. Unfortunately, current practice is to simply lay these cables on top of the seabed without burial or protection, as the traditional tracked trenching machines originally developed for deep sea oil and gas applications are inadequate for the harsh coastal terrain. Cables are therefore exposed to numerous risks such as tidal forces, rock abrasion, snagging from fishing nets etc. Furthermore, unburied HV cables present serious environmental concerns related to local habitat & water temperature.\n\n\nExisting technologies cannot address this growing problem. HexaTerra will develop a novel solution to the problem that builds upon recent advances made in \u2018stepping\u2019 locomotion systems for traversing undulated harsh terrain. This system will provide a robust solution for its environment, by achieving the following objectives: modular design suited to existing trenching machines; mechanical movement subsystem with <5% error in desired motion tracking & <1cm in actual tracking error; control subsystem capable of negotiating \\/-0.5m 90\u00b0 step in terrain & turn on-the-spot; complete simulated locomotion cycle in under 5mins, with <5% desired motion tracking error.\n\n\nUsing this solution the project expects to comprehensively address the problem of damage to subsea energy cables, thereby maximising offshore energy reliability, maintain renewable energy affordability, & minimise the marine environmental impact of cables. In turn, we will deliver a profit of \u20ac10.95m & 100 new high skill jobs to the SME partners after 5 years.", 58976.0, 1227744.0, "HEXATERRA", "Protecting undersea power cables", "High-voltage submarine cables are necessary to transmit offshore wind energy. An EU-funded project is developing an innovative system that traverses the seabed to prevent their damage.", "Offshore wind energy and tidal energy are becoming increasingly important parts of the world clean energy mix, with Europe being at the forefront of energy market reform. However, submarine cables are the main cause of the most frequent insurance claims against offshore wind developments. Given that the conventional trenching machines originally developed for oil and gas applications cannot penetrate the seabed, current practice involves leaving submarine cables above it.\n\nThe EU-funded project http://www.hexaterra.eu/ (HEXATERRA) is designing a modular system suited to existing trenching machines that prevents failure of unburied submarine cables. Possible threats include tidal forces, rock abrasion or snagging from fishing nets.\n\nHEXATERRA's system is a bolt-on locomotion system for an underwater trenching machine that can move in all directions. The system automatically adapts to the terrain, keeping the trench cutting tool stable. Responding to sensor inputs, the machine distributes its weight evenly over the ground and seeks a support base for each of its six legs. Depending on ground irregularity, the machine operator can adjust both the machine ground clearance and the height of each step. It has exact step positioning and spot contact with the ground, with the ability to step over obstacles.\n\nThe user requirement and functional design specifications have been fundamental to the consortium understanding the needs of the underwater locomotion system and the human interface design.\n\nSignificant developments have taken place concerning the human-machine interface and the video overlay. Scientists focused on the relationship between the sensors on the remotely operated vehicle, the stepping platform and the user interface. This should help combine visual and sonar data, and develop a haptic feedback joystick.\n\nOther project tasks have been to perform simulations for investigating the system's dynamic behaviour and developing various operation scenarios.\n\nWith its activities, HEXATERRA is helping maximise the reliability of renewable energy networks. Furthermore, it minimises the adverse impact of high-voltage cables on the surrounding marine environment and prevents a rise in water temperature.", null, "http://www.smd.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/157242.jpg", "fp7_109873_952172953"], ["6TT", "A novel, autonomous and REVersible Inflow control VALve to increase oil production and reservoir recovery rate by stopping the production of unwanted water and gas locally in the reservoirs", "International Syalons Newcastle Limited", "REVIVAL focuses on the problem of maximising recovery of oil from wells and prolonging their productive life; a commercial imperative for the industry and a response to EU policies to secure Europe\u2019s energy supply in respect to oil.\n\nGlobally only 32% of available oil reserves are extracted from oil fields. A 5% increase in the recovery factor would yield as much oil as is expected from all future exploration efforts.\n\nThe reason for low recovery rates is the breakthrough of water or gas in the well. The industry has addressed this by developing inflow control devices (ICD & AICD) that choke oil production both at start up and when gas or water incursion occurs; but do not stop these entering the system.\n\nOur innovative solution utilises the properties of fluid dynamics to create an Autonomous Inflow Control Valve (AICV) that, whilst remaining simple in concept, eliminates the weaknesses of AICD and ICD products. By comparison, proof of concept tests on our AICV show it will increase recovery, does not choke initial oil production, can stop gas and water completely, is autonomous, reversible, reliable and price competitive.\n\nWe have established the concept, but still face significant technical challenges which we need to outsource to specialist R&D partners. These involve developing an innovative laminar flow element, filters and seals that can withstand the harsh environments in wells.\n\nREVIVAL enables our SME partnership to create a novel, highly differentiated, validated pre-production prototype that can be quickly commercialised post project completion, providing outstanding benefits for our own organisations, our oil company clients, national government exchequers and Europe as a whole.

This is important for the oil industry as well as reflecting EU policies to secure Europe's energy supply with regard to oil. Currently, only 32\u00a0% of available oil is extracted from oil fields, while a 5\u00a0% increase in recovery would equal all the oil expected from future exploration activities.\n\nLow recovery rates are due to the breakthrough of gas or water into the well. To counter this problem, industry is developing ICDs and autonomous ICDs (AICDs) that choke oil production when water or gas incursion occurs. However, these do not completely halt their intrusion.\n\nProject partners are using fluid dynamics to develop the prototype for an Autonomous Inflow Control Valve (AICV), which can overcome the weaknesses associated with conventional ICDs and AICDs. Tests on the AICV, which is simple in concept, show it will increase recovery and does not choke initial oil production. In addition it can completely stop water and gas, while being autonomous, reversible, reliable and cost effective.\n\nMajor technical challenges include the development of an innovative laminar flow element, filters and seals. These components must be capable of operating under higher temperature and pressure in the harsh environment within the wells.\n\nResearchers must therefore gain an understanding of the complex interaction between environmental and chemical conditions present in wells and their effect on component materials. These materials comprise ceramics, metals and polymers. REVIVAL will also develop new computational models for simulating well conditions, valve lifetime and reservoir recovery.\n\nThe known market potential for the AICV being developed by REVIVAL is EUR\u00a0224 million within 5 years of the project's completion. A secondary market exists in the form of environmental protection from oil spillage.\n\nREVIVAL will therefore benefit the oil industry, help conserve resources and protect European fuel security.
