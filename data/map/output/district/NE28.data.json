Continued strong growth is predicted. However, a growing problem is manifesting itself within the industry.\n\n\nThe submarine cables that are an essential infrastructural component of offshore energy now account for 80% of insurance claims related offshore renewables. Unfortunately, current practice is to simply lay these cables on top of the seabed without burial or protection, as the traditional tracked trenching machines originally developed for deep sea oil and gas applications are inadequate for the harsh coastal terrain. Cables are therefore exposed to numerous risks such as tidal forces, rock abrasion, snagging from fishing nets etc. Furthermore, unburied HV cables present serious environmental concerns related to local habitat & water temperature.\n\n\nExisting technologies cannot address this growing problem. HexaTerra will develop a novel solution to the problem that builds upon recent advances made in \u2018stepping\u2019 locomotion systems for traversing undulated harsh terrain. This system will provide a robust solution for its environment, by achieving the following objectives: modular design suited to existing trenching machines; mechanical movement subsystem with <5% error in desired motion tracking & <1cm in actual tracking error; control subsystem capable of negotiating \\/-0.5m 90\u00b0 step in terrain & turn on-the-spot; complete simulated locomotion cycle in under 5mins, with <5% desired motion tracking error.\n\n\nUsing this solution the project expects to comprehensively address the problem of damage to subsea energy cables, thereby maximising offshore energy reliability, maintain renewable energy affordability, & minimise the marine environmental impact of cables. In turn, we will deliver a profit of \u20ac10.95m & 100 new high skill jobs to the SME partners after 5 years.", 58976.0, 1227744.0, "HEXATERRA", "Protecting undersea power cables", "High-voltage submarine cables are necessary to transmit offshore wind energy.

However, submarine cables are the main cause of the most frequent insurance claims against offshore wind developments. Given that the conventional trenching machines originally developed for oil and gas applications cannot penetrate the seabed, current practice involves leaving submarine cables above it.\n\nThe EU-funded project http://www.hexaterra.eu/ (HEXATERRA) is designing a modular system suited to existing trenching machines that prevents failure of unburied submarine cables. Possible threats include tidal forces, rock abrasion or snagging from fishing nets.\n\nHEXATERRA's system is a bolt-on locomotion system for an underwater trenching machine that can move in all directions. The system automatically adapts to the terrain, keeping the trench cutting tool stable. Responding to sensor inputs, the machine distributes its weight evenly over the ground and seeks a support base for each of its six legs. Depending on ground irregularity, the machine operator can adjust both the machine ground clearance and the height of each step. It has exact step positioning and spot contact with the ground, with the ability to step over obstacles.\n\nThe user requirement and functional design specifications have been fundamental to the consortium understanding the needs of the underwater locomotion system and the human interface design.\n\nSignificant developments have taken place concerning the human-machine interface and the video overlay. Scientists focused on the relationship between the sensors on the remotely operated vehicle, the stepping platform and the user interface. This should help combine visual and sonar data, and develop a haptic feedback joystick.\n\nOther project tasks have been to perform simulations for investigating the system's dynamic behaviour and developing various operation scenarios.\n\nWith its activities, HEXATERRA is helping maximise the reliability of renewable energy networks.

A 5% increase in the recovery factor would yield as much oil as is expected from all future exploration efforts.\n\nThe reason for low recovery rates is the breakthrough of water or gas in the well. The industry has addressed this by developing inflow control devices (ICD & AICD) that choke oil production both at start up and when gas or water incursion occurs; but do not stop these entering the system.\n\nOur innovative solution utilises the properties of fluid dynamics to create an Autonomous Inflow Control Valve (AICV) that, whilst remaining simple in concept, eliminates the weaknesses of AICD and ICD products. By comparison, proof of concept tests on our AICV show it will increase recovery, does not choke initial oil production, can stop gas and water completely, is autonomous, reversible, reliable and price competitive.\n\nWe have established the concept, but still face significant technical challenges which we need to outsource to specialist R&D partners.

Currently, only 32\u00a0% of available oil is extracted from oil fields, while a 5\u00a0% increase in recovery would equal all the oil expected from future exploration activities.\n\nLow recovery rates are due to the breakthrough of gas or water into the well. To counter this problem, industry is developing ICDs and autonomous ICDs (AICDs) that choke oil production when water or gas incursion occurs. However, these do not completely halt their intrusion.\n\nProject partners are using fluid dynamics to develop the prototype for an Autonomous Inflow Control Valve (AICV), which can overcome the weaknesses associated with conventional ICDs and AICDs. Tests on the AICV, which is simple in concept, show it will increase recovery and does not choke initial oil production. In addition it can completely stop water and gas, while being autonomous, reversible, reliable and cost effective.\n\nMajor technical challenges include the development of an innovative laminar flow element, filters and seals. These components must be capable of operating under higher temperature and pressure in the harsh environment within the wells.\n\nResearchers must therefore gain an understanding of the complex interaction between environmental and chemical conditions present in wells and their effect on component materials.

They are 15 to 20 years old, mostly of rural origin, and are in CAPA or Bac Pro in the sectors of services to persons, advice-sales-commerce, agriculture, agro-equipment, horse trades, landscaping, production horticultural, floristry, food industry, carpentry. The internship objectives are the reinforcement of professional skills (discovery and analysis of new structures and professional practices), linguistic, transversal and civic (to promote self-development, autonomy, socialization and living together) in order to improve its employability .\r\n104 adults (educational team, administrators, masters of internships and apprenticeships) will carry out a one-week internship in Europe to study other European practices (educational, pedagogical, professional, management), strengthen partnerships and to adapt teaching practices to the changing needs of the world of tomorrow, but also to become promoters of European mobility in their establishments and with the networks of companies.\r\n\r\nThe actors are involved from beginning to end on the project, a project team is formed for this purpose.\r\nEligible young people and adults participate in the implementation of logistical and practical aspects, are evaluated at the end of the training course, via several tools including the Europass Mobility.\r\nThe MFRs manage the modalities of cooperation with the European partners (presentation of the internship activities, organization of the accompaniment and the follow-up on the spot, evaluation of the trainees), put in place a pedagogic, linguistic and cultural preparation for the participants, manage the logistical aspects and regularly inform participants and their families, support and evaluate, value the return mobility and disseminate the results to all stakeholders in the region at meetings, meetings, events, events and via social networks and the press.\r\n\r\nThe steering and technical committees are the interface between the Regional Federation and the MFR, ensure the proper implementation of mobility in its stages, monitoring tools have been built for this purpose and are accessible via our space on the digital platform.\r\nThe Regional Federation provides technical support, monitoring, administrative and financial management, promotion and dissemination of the regional project, and controls the quality of the project throughout its duration.\r\n\r\nThe success of these mobilities is guaranteed by the implementation of a project management methodology through:\r\n- provision of human resources at local and regional level: division of tasks, working meetings throughout the project, provision of the necessary elements to support these projects via the digital platform\r\n- regular communication with European partners and participation in mobility networks,\r\n- the establishment of a communication plan for the dissemination of the results\r\n\r\nThe expected results are a better professional integration of young people and professionalization of adults by strengthening their skills, developing their open-mindedness and their commitment as a European citizen.\r\nThe expected impacts are the reinforcement of the quality of the mobilities, the durability of the partnerships, the quantitative increase of outgoing and incoming mobilities, and the development of innovative practices for the structures involved. Erasmus mobility is new, but the communication around their results will make it possible to renew this experience with more young people and thus enable European job mobility.\r\nThe long-term potential benefits are the recognition of the Auvergne Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes MFR network, the reinforcement of their territorial anchorage and their international dimension.
