The discovery and development of new antibiotics is essential to maintain medical advances but poses significant scientific, clinical, and financial challenges, particularly for antibiotics active against Gram-negative bacteria (such as E. coli). Such bacteria have effective barriers against drugs, making treatment difficult, resistance likely and development costs and risks high. In addition, any new antibiotics brought to the market would likely be used cautiously to delay the development of resistance, adding an additional financial challenge in recouping the development costs. The O\u2019Neill Report on AMR identifies diagnostics as critical to the battle against antibiotic resistance.\n\nThis innovation action, BreathSpec, proposes a viable solution to the global problem of AMR through the final developmental stages of an existing diagnostic device, which will allow a rapid, binary decision to be made on the need for antibiotic treatment, and which with suitable optimisation will allow further differentiation and stratification to take place. The Innovation Action includes technical developments to optimise its function, data acquisition for the development of the decision making analytical function and clinical validation.\n\nIt addresses these issues by producing reliable identification and quantification of key signature volatiles present in exhaled breath. It provides a non-invasive method for monitoring the volatile organic compounds present in an individual\u2019s exhaled breath (and subsequently the blood) and has long been recognised as having significant utility as a clinical test that can be used for early disease detection and monitoring, and potentially to diagnose specific bacterial infections for better, more targeted use of existing antibiotics.", 101977.0, 2914227.0, "BreathSpec", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_210626_926919294"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8XR", "Ergotherapie im europ\u00e4ischen Vergleich - Eine Erweiterung beruflicher Kompetenzen und Perspektiven", "Royal Glamorgan Hospital", 10413.0, "The project offers the opportunity to absolve an abroad vocational placement in a medical resp. therapeutic institution in Cheltenham and Wyboston (England, UK), Llantristant (Wales,UK), Helensburgh (Scotland, UK), Strassengel (Austria) and  Mosta (Malta) and Enniscorthy (Ireland)  to seven students of the vocational college of Occupational Therapy Guenzburg. Apart from Ms Mann's placement they are additional four-week-placements to the four regular placements in context of their vocational training. Ms Kaulisch is going to absolve an eleven-week- placement as regular part of her vocational training. The participants have the opportunity to experience their profession,  Occupational Therapy, in a different healthpolitics-related context other than in Germany under the supervision and mentoring of their tutors, who all are occupational therapists with several years of professional experience. The role of occupational therapists in the host countries varies strongly from the German pendant. In this context the students get the opportunity to extend and amplify their professional competences in the practical treating of different kinds of clients. All of the students have the opportunity to use and amplify their skills of professional English (subject of their first year of vocational training), as well as to confirm their skills of everyday English and (partly) learn new languages (Welsh). The placements, they're about to visit in summer/ autumn/ winter 2016 work according to current international guidelines (ICF) and frameworks of Occupational Therapy (OT models like MOHO, CMOP) as well as selected occupational therapy concepts, like sensory integrative therapy, in which the participants will get an insight in. All over Europe occupational therapy shows itself to be a profession in an ongoing dynamic change. In Germany there is a reinforcement of the dualism of vocational college and university studies. For our students this means that they have to compete not only with other graduates from vocational colleges but also with the graduating students from the universities. Our students shall practise their competences, gained during their vocational training at the vocational college of Occupational Therapy Guenzburg in working practically in an abroad occupational therapy institution resp. department. By this they should realize as well as recognize their own competences and value as well as extend them.  Being on their own in an unknown environment in a foreign country the young adults will rise their personal competences and gain more independence, flexibility and personal maturity. \r\nIn addition the language skills of the participants in speaking, comprehension and writing in a foreign language will extend during their stay in the English or Spanish speaking countries. In participating in the Erasmus+ project we want to improve the competitiveness and employability of our students and ease their possible professional entry abroad.", "http://www.cwmtafuhb.wales.nhs.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003775_2"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8TT", "REDKNIGHT CONSULTANCY LTD", 101432.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_15296", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "CF72"}
