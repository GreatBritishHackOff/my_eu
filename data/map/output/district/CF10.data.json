The proposed integrated concept will be first modelled and simulated for different typologies of buildings and water distribution network, then tested at an intermediate level in a full-scale experimental facility in France (AQUASIM) before being finally installed, monitored and evaluated in two pilot projects (including residential and non residential buildings) in the UK (Cardiff - Wales) and Italy (La Spezia).<br/>These demonstrators will be used to assess the societal, environmental and economic benefits of the new integrated concept and also to validate models and technologies in order for the concept to be easily replicable throughout all countries and differing European areas.

Thereby, we will empower Europe to become a global leader in the development and commercialisation of CAR T-cell tools and technologies.", 362578.0, 5136692.0, "CARAT", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_199744_930150655"], ["5BT", "Creating and Delivering Shared and Personalised Multi-Screen Broadcast and Broadband Experiences", "Cisco International Limited", "Surveys show that, although around 80% of people are using a second device (phone, tablet or laptop) when watching TV only 20% of them are engaging with \u2018companion content\u2019.The 2-IMMERSE project will innovate around the delivery of experiences that are created to be multi-screen in production yet delivered to be flexible across single and multiple-screens and responsive to the preferences of individual audience members. \n\nWe will build and trial services that deliver multi-screen experiences of high value content including theatre, Grand Prix motorcycle racing and live professional football in the home, in school and in public venues.
