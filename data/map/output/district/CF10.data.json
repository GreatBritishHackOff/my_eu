The proposed integrated concept will be first modelled and simulated for different typologies of buildings and water distribution network, then tested at an intermediate level in a full-scale experimental facility in France (AQUASIM) before being finally installed, monitored and evaluated in two pilot projects (including residential and non residential buildings) in the UK (Cardiff - Wales) and Italy (La Spezia).<br/>These demonstrators will be used to assess the societal, environmental and economic benefits of the new integrated concept and also to validate models and technologies in order for the concept to be easily replicable throughout all countries and differing European areas.

The training will take place in Brussels (Belgium) in November 2017 and will involve a total of 15 different partners from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Poland, Romania, Egypt, Portugal, Kosovo*, FYROM/Macedonia, UK and Ukraine. The project will involve 30 youth workers/facilitators from 15 different countries. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project is to develop and promote a new positive narrative of inclusion, giving the chance to young europeans and young migrants to meet and share their stories (their journeys) in order to match them with the needs of the communities they live in. To do so, we plan to train youth workers (and educators, staff members, volunteers, etc.) on two complementary methodologies and approaches: on one side, participants will  learn how to use storytelling as a tool that can foster unique encounters and create inclusion (sharing a story is like sharing a bit of ourselves with the people around us: this is the perfect cure to any form of intolerance and radicalization!) ... while on the other side, they will explore and further develop the concept of \"community matching\". This consists in observing local communities and realities in order to find inclusion opportunities that would match with the dreams, hopes and competences of the asylum seekers/migrants/refugees previously met. Participants will therefore transform themselves in storytellers and sociologists, and they will be mentored, in their search for new inclusive methodologies and tools, by interns and volunteers (all migrants and refugees with granted asylum) from the Brussels-based refugees project/network \"Tandem\". Through the TC, we will build the personal and professional capacities of youth workers and educators to deal with the needs and claims for inclusion in the local communities we live in. The specific objectives will be: \r\n- To contribute to migrants and refugees integration by promoting intercultural dialogue, inclusion, tolerance and mutual understanding\r\n- To promote a change of perception towards migration and refugees, within young people and communities\r\n- To avoid generalization and promote \u201creal life encounters\u201d / to meet refugees and collect their stories\r\n- To raise awareness on the feelings, hopes, needs, fears, dreams, expectations, competences and skills of migrants/refugees \r\n- To explore and develop the concept of \"Community matching\"\r\n- To foster the role of youth organizations in creating sustainable integration and bridges among young refugees and young Europeans\r\n- To increase the quality of youth work by providing youth workers and youth organisations with additional tools to address inclusion and integration needs in local communities and in Europe\r\n\r\nThe project also foresees the following expected results: \r\n- A final publication, developed as an online interactive platform, in which thoughts, reflections stories of migrations developed as \u201cmodern fairy-tales\u201d will be presented - each \"fairytale\" (story) will have different open finales among which users will be able to choose: in this way, the platform will show them different opportunities (already existing in their communities) and actions (something that they can also initiate, from daily behaviors to voluntarism) that would allow to reach the \"inlucsion happy ending\". \r\n- Promotion of the concept of \u201ccommunity match\u201d, defined as the opportunity to match the stories, skills and knowledge of the migrants with the needs and opportunities of the community they live in. This will be partially addressed in the final publication and web platform. However we believe the approach should be further developed and tested: for this reason, partners already committed to develop some topic-related local activity, that will allow to test different tools and to better observe the local community (and the possibility to have ... a match!) \r\n- A social campaign aiming at changing the perception and view of local communities towards migrants and refugees: the campaign will play on empathy and strong-impact data that could move citizens and young people to take action in some way. We will develop the campaign thanks to the practical labs that are included in the training course (as tests of Storytelling methodologies)\r\n\r\nThe starting point of any sustainable integration policy should be the respect for migrants and refugees as individuals, with their own stories, dreams and competences.

And it is soon becoming a fundamental feature of modern societies. Intercultural learning was tentatively defined in different studies and conclusions during the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008) as a process \"that comprises an open and respectful exchange or interaction between individuals, groups and organizations with different cultural backgrounds or world views; whereas among its aims are: to develop a deeper understanding of diverse perspectives and practices; to increase participation and the freedom and ability to make choices; to foster equality; and to enhance creative processes\" (European Parliament resolution of 19 January 2016 on the role of intercultural dialogue, cultural diversity and education in promoting EU fundamental values - 2015/2139(INI)).\r\nICL helps youth to better comprehend cultures in modern societies and respect them. It reinforces the communication between people from different cultures and stimulates social interaction. It also helps young people recognize the cultural diversity and recognize the common heritage of humanity. It is therefore a key competence in order to read and adapt to the challenges that Europe is now facing, referring in particular to a generic crisis of values and references and to the continuous influx of migrants and refugees. \r\nHowever, as educators, youth workers and organizers of youth events and activities at the local and at the european level, we feel that this dimension, so important and fundamental, is often given for granted in these projects or it's diminished in what is usually called \"the intercultural night\". We fear this is not how true ICL can be fostered and promoted, we see instead the risk that these practices of competing to present our own countries as touristic offices could be counterproductive, nourishing young people nationalism and radicalism. Therefore, we think it's the moment to act and to go beyond intercultural learning, by experimenting new tools and approaches (I-LAB)!! \r\nWe want, together, to renew our educational approach to ICL: we live in the first globalized society, where everything and everyone is interconnected and where stereotypes are everywhere... but to understand and internalize true ICL we need explanations, debriefings, debates and what we call a \"human touch\". We are all (all our members, educators, trainers, youth workers, volunteers) feeling this need and we are all eager to contribute to the innovation process. The aim of our project is therefore to develop a new innovative approach to ICL and to consequently equip youth trainers, youth workers, organizers and volunteers with the necessary competences, knwoledge and practical tools to foster a human and true intercultural dimension in all the projects they deliver (especially the ones under the E+ framework and especially those addressing refugees and migrants). \r\nThe specific objectives of the course are:\r\nto start a shared and dynamic lab aimed at creating innovative methodologies and tools for intercultural dialogue and learning, with a specific attention to the inclusion and integration processes of young refugees and migrants in the local communities and in the youth organizations\r\nto contribute to the professional and personal development and to improve the competences of the youth workers and educators of partner organizations, providing tools, knowledge and skills useful to face the need for intercultural dialogue among young people and their communities\r\nto contribute to improve quality in youth work, at the local and european level, keeping into consideration the changes and challenges of today\u2019s society as for the inclusion and integration of young people with different cultural backgrounds\r\nto contribute to fight radicalization and xenophobia among young europeans and local communities, providing with opportunities of intercultural dialogue and real and true encounters\r\nIn this way, we will train active multipliers able to intervene at the local level and to develop new events, raising social awareness towards true interculturalism in society and above all in the youth sector.\r\nThe project will involve 2 activities: \r\n- a prep meeting with 10 experts from 7 different countries who will meet in Tortona (Italy) in november 2017 in order to analyze and discuss the theoretical and methodological background and who will develop a draft of the innovative approach in the following two months\r\n- a training course (Tortona, february 2018) for 30 educators/youth workers/junior trainers/organizers and representatives of youth organizations from 16 different countries, who will work together to finalize and test new practical tools for intercultural learning and dialogue, based on the theoretical and methodological inputs given by the experts", "http://www.project2020cic.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT03-KA105-010691_3"], ["3AP", "Intercultural learning and mobility for young people XIplus", "UNA Exchange", 13716.0, "The project Intercultural learning and mobility for young people XIplus is a mobility project within European Voluntary Service, which involves the hosting of 2 english volunteers in the cooperative Ture Nirvane for 4 and 5 months and of 1 german volunteer in association Sant\u2019Andrea.\r\nDuring their stay in Italy they will support the host organizations with activities in the youth, social and cultural field, in contrast with social exclusion and marginalization and for the exchange of best practice in the topic of sustainability and health..

This is a novelty that few would want reversed, but it should not surprise us that the ever-expanding world of online interaction has also come to reflect and feed back into many of the difficulties that human beings have historically encountered in their \u2018real\u2019 existence. Intolerance and \u2018hate\u2019 have been a feature of human society almost since time began. A number of studies have identify an increase in these attitudes over recent years. The problem is that if there is less tolerance of differences, and if the constraints on that intolerance are not watched, then intolerance \u2013 and hate \u2013 will find expression, both in the things that people do and in the things they say. The internet has opened up new ways of saying things, and it has opened up new avenues to say them to more people. The constraints, however, on what we can say online are far fewer than those which exist off-line: we can say things over the Internet that we would not dare to say in public in the \u2018real\u2019 world. If hate speech offline is a problem that societies have recognised, and found the need to address, is online hate speech something that we can ignore? Of course not.\r\nYoung people are already suffering from online hate speech:\r\n \u2022 Across Europe, 6% of 9 to 16-year-old Internet users reported having been bullied online, and 3% confessed to having bullied others.\r\n\u2022 16% of young Internet users in Europe say they have posted comments on the Internet that were hateful towards a person or group of people.\r\n \u2022 78% of the respondents of an online survey stated they had encountered hate speech online on a regular basis. The three most recurrent targets of hate speech were: LGBT people (70%), Muslims including refugees and migrants of Muslim origin (60%) and women.\r\nThe problem is huge, and it becomes bigger and bigger especially in nowadays when we all face economic  breakdown and unemployment as result, huge refugee wave, raise of extremism and terrorism etc. All those challenges contributes to spreading hate speech online, as young people are in the situation of ambiguity and frustration.\r\nIn 2012, Advisory Council on Youth of Council of Europe started the No Hate Speech Movement, the campaign that aimed to combat the hate speech online in all its forms, and with this \u201cNo hate\u201d project we want to contribute to making internet a safer place for young people and to prevent human rights violation online.\r\nThe issues that will be addressed by competences developed during the project are:\r\n\u2022 Decrease the level of aggression and intolerance online through civil society organisations/youth workers.\r\n\u2022 Perception of phenomena of hate speech and its influence on young people's lives.\r\n\u2022 Subjective opinion, memory and bias.\r\n\u2022 Human rights online\r\n\u2022 Peace-building\r\n\u2022 Internet literacy\r\n\u2022 Freedom of speech\r\n\u2022 Promoting intercultural dialogue\r\n\u2022 Preventing radicalization of young people\r\nA project \u201cNo hate\u201d is a long-term project aiming at combating  with the hate speech online and to promote no hate speech movement among young people, if approved it will consist of  TC and YE:\r\nThe first activity, a training course will be run in Armenia, 9-17 September 2016 This will be TC for youth workers teachers and trainers aiming to equip them with knowledge and skills on how to tackle the topic of hate speech with young people through non-formal education.\r\nThe second activity (youth exchange) will be run in Luxembourg on 7-16 December 2017 That will be a youth exchange on internet literacy, that will involve not just young people but also bloggers and online activists. After this exchange, we expect our group to start the online campaign \u201cBe the change: make internet safe for everybody\u201d.", "http://www.project2020cic.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-LU01-KA105-023921_6"], ["5NE", "Labyrinth in the Head", "The Republic of the Imagination", 11560.0, "The main objective of the project \u201eLabyrinth in the Head\u201d is to equip youth workers with Sensory Labyrinth Theatre (SLT) method, which helps them in their every day work with the youth to address personal- and local-level challenges associated with refugees/ migrants and to disseminate the European common values, especially connection to common humanity and compassion. \r\n\r\n6 organisations from 5 European countries, who are partners in this project, have pointed out intolerance towards refugees in their home countries. \r\n\r\nOn the local (community) level people tend to express intolerance through hate speech and hate acts. There have been reports about vandalism in refugee centres in the very beginning they were established. Several neo-nazi groupings have got wind under their wings and right-wing parties have got more supporters. \r\n\r\nOn personal level a lot of local people believe that refugees represent a threat to host countries, that there is a lot of terrorists among refugees, that they want to spread islam and steal jobs from the local. In addition local people are afraid of losing their own identity, nationality, culture, religion, jobs etc. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the core of the problem lies in dehumanization of refugees, dividing people into \u201eus\u201d and \u201ethem\u201d. What is needed most by both refugees and people living in countries who host them is a sense of connectedness: a connection to common humanity. In our opinion, drama methods are best to reach this goal.\r\n\r\nSLT provides this connectedness for those who engage with it. From this connection to common humanity, which transcends cultural and even linguistic differences, compassion emerges naturally. SLT harnesses this emerging compassion and supports participants to channel it in useful ways to support and guide each other through uncertain and precarious times.\r\n\r\n18 youth workers from 5 European countries will meet on 25.09.-04.10.2017 in Tartu, Estonia in a training to learn SLT methods. 8 days long training includes morning and afternoon SLT workshops lead by creator of SLT method, Iwan Brioc, evaluation sessions in the end of every day, SLT performances in the end of the training to try out and share the results of the training, socializing time etc. All this serves the aim to equip the participating youth workers with competence and methods for addressing personal- and local level challenges associated with refugees.\r\n\r\nTo deepen understanding of refugees' situation every group prepares a research of the current refugees crisis as a homework \u2013 what are the main personal- and local-level challenges associated with refugees in their countries. The researches are presented in the beginning of the training session. During training Skype interview with Syrian refugees in Turkey and a meeting with refugees in Estonia take place to provoke intercultural dialogue and search for similarities in differences. \r\n\r\nDuring this training the youth workers have chance to experience the method themselves through exercises. Then they work in groups and create for each other improvisational sensory journeys. Also they can try the method out with the adults. After acquiring the essence of the method they create sensory portals and form a structure of the SLT production for the youth. They learn to use and tune this method on a very specific topic - refugees, which is very relevant in nowadays' world. \r\n\r\nAfter the training 18 youth workers are ready to use SLT in their every day youth work. To test it partner organisations will arrange 4-6 dissemination events after the training course. So the participants/ participating organisations can try out their competence to use SLT as a method to address personal- and local-level challenges associated with refugees, share their multi-pointed overview of the current refugee crisis and disseminate European common values. \r\n\r\nCapacity to use SLT methods in addressing personal- and local-level challenges associated with refugees/ migrants or other socially sensitive topics will be available in youth work field of 6 different countries. Youth workers will use the method of SLT or parts of it (games, exercises) in their daily work with the youth and in community.\r\n\r\nThe local communities and Europe as a whole becomes more tolerant. Disseminating the project results supports the resistance to the hate speech and intolerance and hopefully prevent violent radicalisation of several young people.\r\n\r\n(People in the roles of) refugees/ migrants will find more understanding and help in hosting societies. They will have better opportunities to get involved and integrated into hosting societies. Hosting communities and countries will act more smoothly. Europe as a whole will become again a bit more tolerant. People will acknowledge a little bit more common humanity and compassion in themselves.\r\n\r\nThe project widens its impact through Timo Mikkola's thesis on how to use SLT method in approaching refugee topic, which will be available on web.", "http://www.troti.org", null, "erasmus_2017-2-EE01-KA105-035009_4"], ["3AP", "European Youth Work in South Wales", "UNA Exchange", 65055.0, "\u201cEuropean Youth Work in Wales\u201d will provide a mobility activity for 8 volunteers from Spain, Belgium, France, Poland, Russia and Austria.

It will be held in Kumanovo, Macedonia and Cardiff, Wales, UK and bring together two different partners from distinct different countries; 20 participants will take part support by 4 staff / team members. The youth exchanges will use non-formal methods and activities to help participants connect the use of creative online journalism with inter-cultural learning, breaking down barriers to inclusion, experiential learning, development of critical thinking, developing teamwork and citizenship. The participants will take part in a huge amount of experiential learning themselves through the use of different activities such as research, design, investigative journalism, art, etc..    \r\n\r\nThe main focus of the youth exchanges will be developing an online magazine as a learning tool and form of self development. The educational programme will aim to develop young peoples abilities to use online journalism, artistic pursuits and creativity as a learning tool, formally, informally and non-formally as well as a method of pushing their comfort levels and developing their confidence. Using these methods to raise awareness about youth issues, human separation from the natural world and explore the possibilities to act toward sustainable culture as well as tools for breaking cultural, social and geographical barriers. \r\n\r\nBy exchanging their own experiences on this project, participants will get first-hand practice in inter-cultural learning.

Our public is diverse and so, our projects are, first of all, accessible to all local learners, without any discrimination, yet no level of studies is required or limited age, and also, characterized by destinations, durations, and various sectors of activity. They are fitted to the needs, objectives and profile of each person. Participants are supported with regard to all these criteria and on the motivation and relevance of the participant\u2019s personal and professional project. \r\n\r\nAt the level of the European partners, we work on one hand with intermediate structures which organize the mobility of the participants, and, thus, provide a support to the participants with more difficulties, and on the other hand, we work also more and more directly with host structures and companies. These structures are found, during the whole contract period, and especially selected for the mobility of a participant in specific areas. They also may have already hosted participant within their structure in past projects.\r\nOur partnership network is related to our internalization strategy. It is characterized by a geographical, linguistic and economic diversity a plurality of activities sectors adapted to every public (social, tourism, sale, communication, etc.) and of types of structures (companies, associations, training centers\u2026) Every partner, whether it is a direct structure or intermediate structure, is in charge of providing a quality placement (within its structure or one of its local partners), if possible the accommodation, and a support if the participant is facing difficulties (in the activities, with the team, social or cultural difficulties, or a problem linked to the security of the participant). Indeed, the partner has to provide a quality follow-up during the mobility, and a relevant and fitted evaluation at the end. The diversity of the partners allows us to offer a large panel of relevant opportunities to the participants\u2019 needs and careers. Thus, our international strategy aims at offering internships in companies as well as in associations, in a varied number of professional sectors and in a diversity of countries.\r\n\r\nRegarding the development at the European level, ADICE being a territorial actor of social and professional inclusion, our action plan is in complete relevance with the analysis of the needs at the territorial and sectorial level, but also for the public. Indeed, the Hauts-de-France area is very affected by unemployment, which rate is higher than other area and largely exceeding the national rate (12%, while 9.6% in metropolitan France data given by INSEE for the 2nd trimester 2016). Moreover, the city of Roubaix knows a high economic development, but the rate of unemployment stays high and affects 30.9% of the local population. \r\nWith mobility experience being an entrance to employment, it enables the development of new experiences, skills and opportunities to enrich the professional life, the project of ADICE is thus absolutely relevant at a local level, according to the territory priorities and background. Moreover, a project like this one, allows the development of the territory at a European level, the enlargement of the opportunities and network and the exchange and developpement of new skills among this local network, which is a real added value for our structure but also for the territory.", "http://www.careerchangewales.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-035846_12"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["3NQ", "SMARTInnovation (East Wales)", "WG - Department for Economy, Science and Transport", "Financial support for Welsh businesses to drive forward innovative ideas and turn them into new products, services and technologies ready to bring to the market.", "ERDF", 3779021.0, 7558043.0, "erdf_wales_80751"], ["3NQ", "Ser Cymru II (East Wales)", "WG - Department for Economy, Science and Transport", "Attracting world class expertise to deliver cutting-edge research within Welsh Universities to drive the knowledge economy.", "ERDF", 8000000.0, 18473118.0, "erdf_wales_80762"], ["3NQ", "SMARTCymru (East Wales)", "WG - Department for Economy, Science and Transport", "Providing support for businesses at different stages of their research, development and innovation journey process, including experimental development, industrial research, technical and commercial feasibility and exploitation.", "ERDF", 12259800.0, 29400000.0, "erdf_wales_80825"], ["3AT", "FLEXIS East", "Cardiff University", "World leading energy research scheme, involving collaborations with industry and research organisations in Wales, Europe and worldwide.
