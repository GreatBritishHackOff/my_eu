We strongly believe that Sail Training offers a unique and extremely effective educational experience. We further believe that we have harnessed this outdoor activity to its fullest educational potential by implementing structured learning programmes, which we have designed in accordance with \"Youth Exchange\" guidelines. Sail Training as a stand-alone activity offers the opportunity to overcome fears, push boundaries and take on new responsibilities in a challenging environment. By combining it with a structured programme of facilitated, non-formal learning activities, workshops, discussions and talks, with the specific learning aims set out in this project, we are confident that we can implement a project which is of value to the participants, the youth leaders, the partner organizations and the communities involved. \r\n\r\nMerseyside Adventure Sailing Trust (MAST) UK.\r\nIs very experienced in running youth development projects, using Tall Ship sailing as a medium for challenge based learning. M.A.S.T. is a charity, with an excellent reputation in the Sail Training industry and with very similar ethos and objectives to Sail Training Ireland. Having worked with them on other projects over the past four years, we have found them to be efficient, reliable and enthusiastic about providing quality projects for young people. They have a special expertise in providing workshops in employment skills and personal development. They have a reputation for actively involving young people with fewer opportunities in their projects through support and sponsorship.\r\n\r\nIt is intended to run three main activities: The first is a Mobility of Youth Leaders and the second two are Youth Exchange Projects - one focusing on 15-17 years and the other on 18-30 years. \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants: \r\nThere will be a total of 68 participants and youth leaders on the project. 12 youth leaders will participate in the Youth Leader Mobility. The emphasis will be diversity and inclusion. There will be an equal number of participants from Ireland and the UK. There will be an equal gender balance and a focus on inclusive participation for young people with fewer opportunities \r\n\r\nObjectives In this project\r\nSTIRL and MAST will build on previous experience by focusing on:\r\na) The personal and professional development of youth leaders,\r\nb) The development of transferable skills in participants, and their application to future employment opportunities particularly in the maritime sector. \r\nc) Inclusion and diversity and an acceptance of different backgrounds and abilities. Inclusion and diversity will be a core ethos in the recruitment of participants .\r\nd) Improving and strengthening the collaboration between the partner organisations. \r\ne)Promoting participants confidence and willingness to participate actively in society \r\n\r\nMain activities:\r\nYouth Leader Mobility weekend over two days the youth leaders will have the opportunity to brainstorm, contribute ideas to and practice the implementation of programme activities. They will develop competences necessary to deliver non-formal educational programmes and to work in a ship environment. \r\nUnder 18s Youth Exchange Voyage and Over 18s Youth Exchange Voyage \r\nThe Youth Exchanges will be run consecutively on the same Tall Ship. Each voyage will last 11 days (10 nights) and visit a number of UK and Irish ports. The participants will develop hard-skills necessary to sail a tall ship and will have responsibilities such as keeping watch, helming, cleaning and galley duty. The youth leaders will facilitate learning through activities, reviews and journal writing to achieve the stated learning aims.\r\nCareer opportunities in the maritime sector and educational pathways will be explored. The following are examples of competencies that will be developed, many are specifically relevant to employability and to potential careers in the maritime industries: communicate and work in a team, leadership skills, conflict resolution, ability to work on own initiative, delegation, organisational, time management and personal and interpersonal skills. Also develop a greater understanding of different cultures.\r\n\r\nTechnical skills\r\nSeamanship skills, ship operation skills, engineering requirements on a ship, understanding of the shipping industry Youthpass will be used as a mechanism to facilitate self-led learning and record learning achievements.\r\n\r\nImpact of the Project\r\nThe project will impact on the overall personal development, skills, competences and employability of the participants and youth leaders.\r\nInclusion, diversity and accessibility will be highlighted as issues to be aware of in their communities. \r\n\r\nParticipants will be likely to take a more proactive role within their communities.", "http://www.mastcharity.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-IE01-KA105-038561_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CH64"}
