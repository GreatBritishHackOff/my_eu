It is suggested that the more citizens find connections between their as-usual life activities and relevant policies, the more they become pro-active or motivated to be involved in the PMPs. For this reason, UbiPOL aims to provide context aware knowledge provision with regard to policy making. That is citizens using UbiPOL will be able to identify any relevant policies and other citizen's opinion whenever they want wherever they are according to their as-usual life pattern. With the platform, citizens  are expected to be more widely aware of any relevant policies and PMPs for involvement during their as-usual life therefore improved engagement and empowerment. Also, the platform will provide policy tracking functionality via a workflow engine and opinion tag concept to improve the transparency of the policy making processes. Finally, the platform enable policy makers to collect citizen opinions more efficiently as the opinions are collected as soon as they are created in the middle of citizen's usual life. UbiPOL is provides security and identity management facility to ensure only authorised citizens can have access to relevant policies according to their roles in policy making processes. The delivery of the opinion and policy data over the wireless network is secure as the platform use leading edge encryption algorithm in its communication kernels. UbiPOL is a scalable platform ensuring at least 100,000 citizens can use the system at the same time (for example, for e-Voting applications) via its well proven automatic load balancing mechanisms. The privacy ensuring opinion mining engine prevents unwanted revealing of citizen identities and the mining engine prevents any unrelated commercial advertisements are included in the opinion base to minimise misuse of the system.", 87511.0, 2430265.0, "UbiPOL", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_93844_997416566"], ["2TA", "Future Policy Modeling", "Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council", "The FUPOL project proposes a comprehensive new governance model to support the policy design and implementation lifecycle. The innovations are driven by the demand of citizens and political decision makers to support the policy domains in urban regions with appropriate ICT technologies. It will specifically target domains such as urban economy, community facilities, urban mobility and sustainable tourism. The scientific approach is based on complexity science. It aims at reducing the complexity through a comprehensive policy spiral design lifecycle approach, deemed appropriate for complex societal problems.The outcomes of the project, designed in line with the ICT work program, include a new governance model to engage all stakeholders in the whole policy design lifecycle, a policy knowledge database,  cloud computing based comprehensive ICT framework, multilingual training, piloting in Europe, China and Africa, large scale dissemination and a sustainable exploitation strategy.The FUPOL framework to support the policy lifecycle contains major innovations, namely multichannel social computing, policy topic sensing and extraction, advanced visualization including integration with GIS, multilingual semantic analysis, advanced policy modelling and model repository, dynamic agent based simulation, cloud computing and IMS supported crowd sourcing.FUPOL will lead to better policy  decisions, more efficient implementation of government policies as well as better identification of consequences for citizens and businesses.  The FUPOL consortium comprises innovative multinational companies, leading research institutes, high-level political organizations and strong pilot partners.

This is crucial in order for them to be able to participate in working life after completing their education. This will again probably prevent early school leaving, less unemployed young people, and all the qualities of life that reseachers have found that is related to having a job, feeling attractive in working life and being able to take care of yourself financially. \r\n\r\nSecond: In Programme for service and transportation there seems to be rather many students who strive with lack of motivation to attend this educational programme and to finish their studies. This is due to that it might be their third choice, and they would preferred to study something else, but they could not get to that program. Many of these students are less motivated for theory and may also have light learning difficulties. At the same time, this specific vocational program often is teached in a very theoretical way.  We want to make stronger connection between learning and practical training by much more use of job training from the very beginning of the first level, find a model for cooperating with and follow up learning in local businesses (and may be later, provide options for work training abroad). Thus, we want to make learning more interesting, increase learning outcomes, prevent drop-out, and help more young people to get relevant jobs.\r\n\r\nThe participants involved in this project will be 6 program teachers from the department of adapted teaching and 5 teachers from the education program for service and transport at Stend Vidareg\u00e5ande Skule. \r\n\r\nThe teachers are going to do short-term job shadowing at 3 different schools in England, Germany and Sweden, Two of them are chosen because they have worked out a good model for cooperating with local businesses, and letting the students learn while \u201cdoing a real job with real challenges\u201d. We hope to learn from them and take the knowledge home to our school. \r\n\r\nBarnsley College work with social and professional skills to qualify students for\r\nthe UK job market.They have an education programme for students with learning and behavioral disabilities, focusing on social skills for life and work management.\r\nThe development in the British labor market lies ahead of the development in Norway, especially in relation to automation and mechanization. It is therefore of great interest for us to look at how Barnsley College work with social and professional skills to qualify students for the UK job market.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results will be renewed teaching practices with better customized training, use of work-relevant tasks and more emphazise on social skills for students who need this. Hopefully long term effect will be that students  find it more motivating and easier to learn at school. In the end lead we expect that more students achieve a passing grade and that fewer drop out of secondary education and that more young people get a relevant job that they are happy with and an income they can live from.", "http://www.barnsley.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NO01-KA102-038746_1"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["2TA", "Superfast South Yorkshire Business", "Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council", "This project will actively raise the awareness and understanding of what new technology, enabled by faster broadband, can achieve with the aim of raising the adoption and participation levels in SCR.
