It is suggested that the more citizens find connections between their as-usual life activities and relevant policies, the more they become pro-active or motivated to be involved in the PMPs. For this reason, UbiPOL aims to provide context aware knowledge provision with regard to policy making. That is citizens using UbiPOL will be able to identify any relevant policies and other citizen's opinion whenever they want wherever they are according to their as-usual life pattern. With the platform, citizens  are expected to be more widely aware of any relevant policies and PMPs for involvement during their as-usual life therefore improved engagement and empowerment. Also, the platform will provide policy tracking functionality via a workflow engine and opinion tag concept to improve the transparency of the policy making processes. Finally, the platform enable policy makers to collect citizen opinions more efficiently as the opinions are collected as soon as they are created in the middle of citizen's usual life. UbiPOL is provides security and identity management facility to ensure only authorised citizens can have access to relevant policies according to their roles in policy making processes. The delivery of the opinion and policy data over the wireless network is secure as the platform use leading edge encryption algorithm in its communication kernels. UbiPOL is a scalable platform ensuring at least 100,000 citizens can use the system at the same time (for example, for e-Voting applications) via its well proven automatic load balancing mechanisms. The privacy ensuring opinion mining engine prevents unwanted revealing of citizen identities and the mining engine prevents any unrelated commercial advertisements are included in the opinion base to minimise misuse of the system.", 87511.0, 2430265.0, "UbiPOL", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_93844_997416566"], ["2TA", "Future Policy Modeling", "Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council", "The FUPOL project proposes a comprehensive new governance model to support the policy design and implementation lifecycle. The innovations are driven by the demand of citizens and political decision makers to support the policy domains in urban regions with appropriate ICT technologies. It will specifically target domains such as urban economy, community facilities, urban mobility and sustainable tourism. The scientific approach is based on complexity science. It aims at reducing the complexity through a comprehensive policy spiral design lifecycle approach, deemed appropriate for complex societal problems.The outcomes of the project, designed in line with the ICT work program, include a new governance model to engage all stakeholders in the whole policy design lifecycle, a policy knowledge database,  cloud computing based comprehensive ICT framework, multilingual training, piloting in Europe, China and Africa, large scale dissemination and a sustainable exploitation strategy.The FUPOL framework to support the policy lifecycle contains major innovations, namely multichannel social computing, policy topic sensing and extraction, advanced visualization including integration with GIS, multilingual semantic analysis, advanced policy modelling and model repository, dynamic agent based simulation, cloud computing and IMS supported crowd sourcing.FUPOL will lead to better policy  decisions, more efficient implementation of government policies as well as better identification of consequences for citizens and businesses.  The FUPOL consortium comprises innovative multinational companies, leading research institutes, high-level political organizations and strong pilot partners.
