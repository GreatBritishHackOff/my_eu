The TEAM project was supported through one of these organisations. \r\n\r\nThe TEAM Project will engage youth through the Strabane Youth Office, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. Government District (LGD) scores show that the Strabane area is ranked 2nd lowest in Northern Ireland in relation to Multiple Deprivation with some of its areas ranking within the top 10% deprived areas. Strabane has a total population of 40,022 of which 34.4% are youth aged 4 \u2013 25 years old. However, only 18.2% of youth engage with the Youth Office (Youth Office Database 2010-2011) and so more needs to be done to engage with young people by providing youth led programmes including leadership training which will provide pathways to qualifications that will leave a lasting legacy of new community youth workers across this deprived area. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the TEAM project is to:\r\n(i) learn about the European Union, local governance and the Erasmus+ programme to explore opportunities for youth participation and future project ideas (Empower)\r\n(ii) reflect on and share leadership styles and practices through peer learning to promote professional development (Empower) \r\n(iii) network and share experiences of Erasmus+ projects to learn the benefits of participating in projects (Animate)\r\n(iv) share new methodologies and tools to improve skill to engage with local youth (Animate)\r\n(v) be an active citizen, to communicate and engage in democratic life (Multiplier)\r\n\r\nPartners: Germany, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Northern Ireland (UK)\r\n\r\nTraining will be delivered to 5 youth workers from each partner region during a 5 day training in Northern Ireland (UK).
