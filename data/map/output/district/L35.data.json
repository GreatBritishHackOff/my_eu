Possible areas of performance and LO have been identified by the partners mentioned in the relevant sections C. This action will respond to the strategy of improving the quality of training and prepare students adequately for entering into the job market or university; enhance the certification of skills in the informal sector (see training); improve the personal growth of the individual paths.\r\ninternational mobility for a period of nine days for 7 teachers and expert in guidance and mentoring in international training centers in the UK and Malta. This action will respond to the strategy of enabling a new way of \"doing school\" through the continuous training of teachers and technical staff of the school; raise the quality of mobility experiences of the students and their certification of skills.\r\nBoth macro-actions will contribute to achieving the objective of consolidating the local network, regional and international level between the worlds of education and employment.\r\nSince the implementation of the internationalization plan in 2015 the Sarrocchi Institute established the relationships with training centers and international companies, (eg Foyle, Cap Ulysse) and created new contacts with companies able to identify the quality of training paths in accordance with the professional figures in output by the Institute. The Institute has consolidated relationships with local companies, available to participate in the candidate selection process and moments of the final evaluation of the project and its impact.\r\nFinally Sarrocchi identified the alternating training of teachers in tutoring and counseling for 2018-2019, supplementary to the mobility actions.\r\nThe project management actions correspond to established practices as:\r\n- Signing of the MOU for single professionals;\r\n- Information and selection of candidates and staff through the procedures included in the request for Vet Charter. For staff the selection criteria are as follows: experiences related to international mobility 50%, 20% language skills, 30% motivation and ability to impact at the return.\r\nDefinition of LA in collaboration with international partners\r\n- Mobilities for students and staff as following flows:\r\n25-06/ 2018: 25 students in UK, 10 students in France\r\n01-10/ 2018:  4 staff in UK and 3 staff in Malta\r\n24-06/ 2019:  15 students in UK and 15 students in Malta\r\n02-09/2019:   15 students in Spain\r\nEvaluation of the results, recognition and certification of skills and ECVET points. Development of Europass certificates and review of CV for students and staff.\r\n- Dissemination, project evaluation and impact by developing a survey to gather feedback from students and the participating staff mobility to be used to reprogram and center more accurately other mobility initiatives\r\nThere is no change of purpose than envisaged in the strategy of internationalization. Primary goal is to improve the professional skills, language and key to all the participants. Secondary objective is to improve the practices and the educational offer of the school.\r\nIt confirms both the learning objectives for individuals and for the Institute strategies and its international partners. The numbers of participants in mobility have been expanded: 80 students and 7 staff.\r\nIt was predicted 5 leaders (1 for flow) for 10 days to facilitate the insertion of the students in the company and especially to facilitate their first contact with the international environment and intercultural aspects, according with new styles and customs.", "http://www.gdha.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005744_11"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["5DR", "RBN", "WHISTON HOSPITAL"], ["3SX", "RBS", "ALDERHEY CHILDRENS HOSPITAL AT WHISTON PRIMARY CARE RESOURCE CENTRE"], ["5DR", "RQ6", "WHISTON HOSPITAL"], ["5DR", "RTV", "STEPHENSON SUITE - WHISTON HOSPITAL"], ["5DR", "RTV", "WHISTON HOSPITAL"], ["5DR", "RWW", "ST HELEN'S & KNOWSLEY HOSPITALS TRUST"], ["5DR", "RWW", "WHISTON HOSPITAL"], ["5DR", "RY2", "WHISTON HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "L35"}
