J. Enthoven Limited", "The COLABATS project will provide new industrial processes for the recycling of the critical metals Cobalt and Lanthanides and key economic metals Nickel and Lithium, from waste batteries, significantly improving recycling efficiencies and metal purity from existing recovery routes. Primarily Li-ion and NiMH will be targeted using novel task specific ionic liquids (TSILs) to selectively extract the metals. These batteries are found in everyday consumer products such as mobile phones, portable media players, etc., as well as other industrial equipment, and are prevalent in hybrid and electric vehicles, which are becoming increasingly widespread on our roads.\nTSILs are molecules covalently tethered to a functional group. Targeted species will be low-cost, non-toxic, environmentally benign, and will require minimal or no processing to reuse them.\nThe battery recycling processes will be up-scaled to a pilot system using standard hydrometallurgical equipment and will include other novel concepts to further improve the process. The pilots will be operated in an industrial setting at battery recycling plants and demonstrated to the wider recycling and battery communities.\nThe technology will result in:\n\u2022 Substantially reducing landfill waste by recovering recyclable metals of high purity\n\u2022 Reducing critical metal consumption by increasing recycling efficiencies of spent battery waste. Hence, high purity recovered metals can be recycled into new batteries rather than landfilling or in the case of nickel, processed into lower value stainless steel.\n\u2022 Substantially reducing environmental impact by introducing more sustainable hydrometallurgical processing to replace current standard pyrometallurgical processes. This will reduce energy consumption and emissions of CO2 and other pollutants.\n\u2022 Increasing the capability of the SME community to carry out the complete recycling process, thereby taking advantage of the potential value chain of critical and high value metals markets.", null, 3590857.0, "COLABATS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.g-pbatt.co.uk", null, "fp7_111072_918106262"], ["4FF", "Knowledge Based Process planning and Design for Additive Layer Manufacturing", "Econolyst Limited", "Mass production is shifted towards the countries with lower factor cost. European industry must search for a chance in customized and hi-tech products, trying to take advantage of its supremacy regarding new technologies development. Aerospace industry, automotive industry, medical implants, hi-end equipments industry, consumer products, protection and safety are the target sectors \u2013which include more than a million of European enterprises in real need of customized product. Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) -also known as Free Form Fabrication and formerly Rapid Manufacturing-, is a novel fabrication method of parts directly from the electronic model by layer manufacturing, using active principles such as laser and Electron beams. Currently, ALM is the first and the best option for short series of customized products. However, layered manufacturing is not without challenges. Part properties, dimensional accuracy and surface quality depend strongly on process planning, and sometimes prevent ALM parts to be considered as fully functional. The objective of KARMA is to respond to above mentioned challenges with a knowledge-based engineering system (KBE) that can estimate functional properties of ALM parts automatically and in short time. The KBE system would define the optimal production parameters automatically and execute a virtual test of the fabricated part. The KBE system will include a database with characterized material and part properties for all major ALM technologies. The development of such a KBE system is a difficult and demanding task, which will involve both ALM users and companies from the final customer sectors. A combination of mass production metal IAGs (FEMEVAL) and ALM IAGs (ASERM, AFPR and RAPIMAN) set up the proposal as a cohesion factor between material providers, technology providers, part fabricants and end-users to promote ALM knowledge among all of them.", 17740.0, 1719727.0, "KARMA", "Process planning tools customise products", "Process planning tools customise products", "Cost-effective production techniques with fast set-up times and high flexibility are required to produce specialised parts for industries such as aerospace and biomedicine. Additive layer manufacturing, also called rapid manufacturing, is perfectly suited to the task. It builds up parts of complex geometries by adding successive layers of materials via instructions from a computer-aided design file.\n\nProcess planning tools developed within the context of the EU-funded project 'Knowledge based process planning and design for additive layer manufacturing' (http://www.karmaproject.eu (KARMA)) will enable fast and easy optimisation, encouraging greater uptake and European supremacy in the field. Previously, selection of the appropriate additive layer manufacturing technology and setup of process parameters required extensive experience and in-house expertise.\n\nPartners from complementary areas worked closely on the demanding task of developing a knowledge-based engineering system to guide process setup and control. A database of material properties and part properties covers four major additive layer manufacturing technologies and eight common materials.\n\nAn 'Expert Process Planning' tool utilises the knowledge-based engineering system to help manufacturers choose the appropriate technology, material and build scenario for their specific part. The tool quickly and automatically estimates functional properties of the part, defining optimal process parameters and executing a virtual production test. The KARMA tool enhances design efficiency and final product quality through rapid design and production of high-quality customised parts for high-tech sectors. This in turn, also facilitates certification in sectors with rigid regulations such as the aerospace and biomedical fields.\n\nKARMA has created a user-friendly knowledge-based engineering tool for European manufacturers that will have a major impact on the EU economy.

The Robotic Explorer (UX-1) will use non-invasive methods for autonomous 3D mine mapping for gathering valuable geological and mineralogical information. This will open new exploration scenarios so that strategic decisions on the re-opening of Europe\u2019s abandoned mines could be supported by actualised data that can not be obtained by any other ways. The Multi-robot Platform will represent a new technology line that is made possible by recent developments in autonomy research that allows the development of a completely new class of mine explorer service robots, capable of operating without remote control. Such robots do not exist nowadays; UX-1 will be the first of its kind. Research challenges are related to miniaturisation and adaptation of deep sea robotic technology to this new application environment and to the interpretation of geoscientific data. Work will start with component validation and simulations to understand the behavior of technology components and instruments to the application environment. This will then be followed by the construction of the first Prototype. Post processing and data analysis tools will be developed in parallel, and pre-operational trials are launched in real life conditions. In the final stage of the project extensive pilots will take place during which UX-1 will be iteratively improved after each trial session, which will be increasingly demanding.

Today, the stigmas of wars are still present.\r\nAs the capital of the Somme department and committed to the organization of the centenary of the Great War, Amiens offers to the young people suitable infrastructures to carry out the project.
