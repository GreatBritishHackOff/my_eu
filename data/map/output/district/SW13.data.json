It originated in a recognition that we had little knowledge of alternative approaches to teaching economics outside of the UK,  alongside a desire to create additional international co-operation and collaboration in high school economics.   Our longer-term aim from this will be to develop international collaboration in high school economics with a view to creating an Olympiad competition.\r\n \r\nIt will involve a single member of staff who is a senior teacher with extensive experience economics and of UK economics education. \r\n It will allow them to explore what topics are taught in both micro-economics and macro-economics.  It will explore how the coverage differs from the UK A level and Pre-U courses, which we have extensive experience in.  It will also explore the approach to teaching economics in France and how pedagogy differs from the UK.  There will be a particular focus on \"stretch and challenge\", with a view to helping to identify which topics could be used as the basis for an international Economics Olympiad (based upon elements of the CORE e-book).  The long term benefits in our school will be an improvement in economics teaching, with a wider range of topics and pedagogical approaches. The wider long term benefits arising out of the project will include both: increased European co-operation and sharing of ideas; and the creation of an international Olympiad.", "http://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk", "St Paul's School London", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036025_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SW13"}
