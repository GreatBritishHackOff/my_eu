The school's philosophy is to use methods which will increase the potential of learners, the vitality of the Italian language and the enjoyment of learning. For this, particular attention is devoted to the best existing emerging methodologies and advanced pedagogy.\r\n\r\nSince 2014 Vivere l'italiano has  also been a  teacher training centre which regularly organizes seminars, themed and bespoke workshops for their own tutors and external teachers.\r\n\r\nThe project \"Teaching Italian Through and with Glottodramma , Multimedia and Technology\",  complements and broadens, a work path which Vivere l'italiano embarked and recently culminated in the creation of Vivere l'italiano Teacher's Training Centre. It will start with the training of two key role members of the staff in Glottodramma and Creating Multimedia Activities  for Language Teaching Training. The participants are a language tutor specialised in teaching Italian as a L2 and LS with sound experience in the theatre field, and the Course Coordinator,  trainer  specialised in teaching MACs (mixed ability classes), assisted by technology.\r\n\r\nObjectives, in the short and long term, of the project, which fit in with school's overall European Development Plan, are:\r\n\r\n1) increasing knowledge and awareness of the teachers of how new tools and  modern methodologies can be used in class to optimize the learning experience of the180 Vivere l'italiano students\r\n2) cascading the activities and outcome through the training of our teachers\r\n3) creating a network of international contacts\r\n4) launching, within the existing Vivere l'italiano Teacher Training, a Glottodramma Training  and Technology Enhanced Language Learning Departments (TELL).\r\n\r\nThe results and impact envisaged can be summarised in:\r\n\r\na) highly qualified and trained staff\r\nb) empowered learning for the school's students\r\nc) innovation and modernisation of Vivere l'italiano' s teaching methods and curricula\r\nd) a wider audience, from different background, of learners, trainees and teachers\r\ne) a network of international contacts. As part of this International strategy Vivere l'italiano would like to develop international collaborations with global universities, research institutes and organisations with the aim to modernise and globalise our curriculum  and in order to better equip the school's  students and staff to live and work in a globalised world\r\nf) the Glottodramma Training  Dep. will be the first one in the UK of this type whilst TELL will specialise in training deployed both locally and at a distance or a as part of a blended approach (i.e a combination of traditional and e-learning approaches). We envisage a very good response considering the vast number of people who could be reached at a local and international levels.\r\n\r\nVivere l'italiano will be disseminating the results through its website,  the school's networks (LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter), educational channels, reports and newsletters to relevant stakeholders and European and International language and theatre students, teachers and trainees.", "http://www.viverelitaliano.com", "Vivere l'italiano Ltd.", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA104-013240_coordinator"], ["9JT", "ECONOMICS EDUCATION IN FRANCE", "St Paul's School London", 2024.0, "The project will equip a member of staff with detailed knowledge of how Economics is taught within the French education system.  It originated in a recognition that we had little knowledge of alternative approaches to teaching economics outside of the UK,  alongside a desire to create additional international co-operation and collaboration in high school economics.   Our longer-term aim from this will be to develop international collaboration in high school economics with a view to creating an Olympiad competition.\r\n \r\nIt will involve a single member of staff who is a senior teacher with extensive experience economics and of UK economics education. \r\n It will allow them to explore what topics are taught in both micro-economics and macro-economics.  It will explore how the coverage differs from the UK A level and Pre-U courses, which we have extensive experience in.  It will also explore the approach to teaching economics in France and how pedagogy differs from the UK.  There will be a particular focus on \"stretch and challenge\", with a view to helping to identify which topics could be used as the basis for an international Economics Olympiad (based upon elements of the CORE e-book).  The long term benefits in our school will be an improvement in economics teaching, with a wider range of topics and pedagogical approaches. The wider long term benefits arising out of the project will include both: increased European co-operation and sharing of ideas; and the creation of an international Olympiad.", "http://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk", "St Paul's School London", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036025_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SW13"}
