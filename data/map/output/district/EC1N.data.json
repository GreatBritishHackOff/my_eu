The market is very interesting, but very competitive too, with an increasing demand of games that are bigger, better and with more realistic computer graphics.<br/>Such qualitative and quantitative advancements in videogames present many draw backs for developers related to increasing costs, need of complex management systems, longer asset creation pipelines etc.. These factors have direct negative consequences on the videogames industry in Europe: they reduce the number of titles released, impede creativity involved (a typical equation is: the more original the idea resulting in a bigger risk and thus lower investment), they stifle innovation and this may cause a financial overexposure of developers.<br/>In CR-PLAY we propose an innovative mixed pipeline for videogames development which will drastically reduce both time and expenses involved in the creation of assets, and make high quality realistic contents accessible even to small game developers. Game developers will be able to capture and reconstruct houses, buildings, trees and other real life elements by simply taking a few sequences of photos and videos to be processed by the semi-automatic software created in the project and integrated with traditional assets made of polygons and textures.<br/>CR-PLAY's approach will represent a major shift in the content creation pipeline for games, with an important positive impact on development costs and time-to-market. The simplicity, speed and quality of the new pipeline will have far-reaching consequences, freeing resources to achieve more creative games faster and cheaper and consequently giving a significant competitive edge to the European SMEs in the game sector.", 137265.0, 2780342.0, "CR-PLAY", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110377_951566994"], ["2ST", "Measurement, Effect Assessment and Mitigation of Pollutant Impact on Movable Cultural Assets. \u2013 Innovative Research for Market Transfer", "Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England", "The MEMORI proposal will provide the conservation market with innovative measurement technology, improved pollution effects knowledge and evaluation and control methods for the reduction of gaseous pollutant impact on movable cultural assets, - facilitating increased and safe use of protective enclosures for cultural heritage (CH) objects located indoors in new or rebuilt buildings for collections, to satisfy demands for energy saving to mitigate climate change. MEMORI will develop a small novel portable instrument for easy combined (oxidising \\ acidic impacts) environmental dosimetry in situ with adapted software and web page for results presentation and interpretation. MEMORI will do extensive laboratory and non-destructive field analysis of impact of indoor environments on a range of organic CH materials for the assessment of environmental quality for movable cultural assets, especially focusing on objects protected inside diverse types of enclosures. MEMORI will perform varied realistic experiments and studies of methods for mitigation of the pollution impact on CH objects in enclosures such as; use of absorbing media of different types;  pollution barrier films; low emitting construction materials, and anoxic conditions. MEMORI seeks to achieve its goals by engagement of SMEs that combine expertise in marketing and consulting of conservation equipment with practical conservation experience for the benefit of conservators and stakeholders, supporting their effort to assure optimal conservation conditions for their collections.

The project was coordinated by the Norwegian Institute for Air Research and carried out by 14 partners, 4 subcontractors and an advisory end-user group.\n\nTogether, MEMORI partners looked at the role that organic acids (acetic and formic) play in accelerating the ageing of organic materials.\nThey performed experiments at laboratories, primarily testing cellulosic material, varnish, pigments (including inorganic pigments), parchments, textiles and leather.Results showed that all organic materials were impacted by their exposure to organic acids, and in some cases even at very low levels.\n\nNext, the group looked at the use of absorption materials to reduce the presence of organic acids in enclosures. Priority was given to materials with high absorption rates at a low cost. Data from the above experiments were used to develop new recommendations for tolerable pollutant levels.\n\nMEMORI also built on technologies from two earlier EU projects, AMECP and MASTER, to create two devices to measure IAQ.\nThe devices, called dosimeters, are sensitive to indoor climate, light and acidic air pollutants, and come in a permanent and hand-held form.\nOne university partner went further to develop a luminescence-based oxygen sensor to test oxygen in airtight enclosures.\n\nUsed in conjunction with new online software created by MEMORI, museums can now measure IAQ, evaluate its risk and decide on cost-effective mitigation strategies.

The proposed project would provide much more precise timings of key features and trends in the European Neolithic sequence than are currently available, and much more precise estimates of the duration of events and phenomena, principally through the application of formal chronological modelling in a Bayesian statistical framework. From these it would open up fundamental new insights into the tempo of change through the detailed study of selected sites and situations across the span of the European Neolithic, especially in the sixth, fifth and fourth millennia cal BC. At stake is our ability to study the lives of Neolithic people everywhere at the scale of generations and even decades, as opposed to the more usual scale of centuries. The proposed project would develop the types of application of Bayesian chronological modelling currently undertaken and would offer the beginnings of a new kind of European prehistory, and the opportunity to rethink wider archaeological approaches to the study of time.\n\nThe legacy of the project would be a series of case studies published in papers in leading journals, two books, and a series of seminars and conference presentations and sessions designed to reinforce best practice for the future.", 1225717.0, 2049678.0, "THETIMESOFTHEIRLIVES", null, null, null, null, "http://www.english-heritage.org.uk", null, "fp7_103384_987006041"], ["2HT", "TrustwOrthy model-awaRE Analytics Data platfORm", "Lightsource Renewable Energy Holdings Limited", "The TOREADOR project is aimed at overcoming some major hurdles that until now have prevented many European companies from reaping the full benefits of Big Data analytics (BDA).

The objective is to develop novel, validated models for the service life time and energy prediction of PV modules and systems. The elements to this puzzle are researched in the frame of 14 PhD projects with individual areas of focus, such as (a) climatic degradation factors, (b) system analytics, (c) material (polymer) parameters, (d) service life & energy models, (e) linking production to performance and (f) performance enhancement by improved O&M.
