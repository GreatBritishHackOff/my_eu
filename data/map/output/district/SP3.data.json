MAPPING would specifically investigate and debate the existing innovation policies, business models and legal framework related to the implementation of the Digital Agenda for Europe and the changes needed to set up an improved governance structure for the EU innovation ecosystem. The key to MAPPING\u2019s success would be its planned mobilisation of a wide spectrum of ICT-related stakeholders and social actors from both EU Member States and associated countries, including academics, law and policy makers, ISPs, international and EU Internet governance bodies, NGOs and civil society organisations. The project would provide these actors with a forum for informed discussion of issues related to the digital transition, such as problems of personal data and IPR protection online, business models and e-government applications based on the use of personal data, economic exploitation of IPRs and open innovation. MAPPING would then move to create an Action Plan and put forward workable policy guidelines based on a multidisciplinary perspective on the latest and foreseeable developments in ICTs taking into account conflicting interests, perceptions and practices of different societal actors that shape the EU\u2019s technological future.  MAPPING would thus significantly contribute to creating an enabling framework for completing the digital transition and improving the innovation climate in the EU.", 166578.0, 3744813.0, "MAPPING", null, null, null, null, "http://www.federatedbusiness.org", null, "fp7_111214_955798425"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SP3"}
