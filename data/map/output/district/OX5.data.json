However, timber is combustible, unlike concrete or steel, and this has significant implications for how it is used within the construction industry as the fire performance (surface spread of flame and structural integrity) must be considered for all building applications.\n\nIn Europe there have been a number of serious fires involving buildings based around structural timber frame (~2.5 million reported fires p.a. causing 20-25,000 deaths and 250-500,000 injuries  of which over 50% is attributed to fires in timber frame buildings   in Europe at a cost of between 0.2-0.3% of GDP or ~\u20ac100 billion in Europe ).\n\nThere is significant industry concern that existing protective wood coating products do not provide the levels of performance (fire resistance) needed to satisfy the increased use of timber for structures due to sustainability benefits.\n\nTherefore there is a need to develop protective coating systems with enhanced fire resistance which will help to maintain or prolong structural integrity of timber in a fire situation, thus increasing time available for safe evacuation and increased potential to keep structure/time for fire service to arrive.\n\nThe REACTAFIRE project aims to overcome the limitations associated with currently used fire protection coatings by developing a unique advanced timber coating which will act to provide at least 60 minutes resistance to fire. This will be done by forming a durable wood char layer which will provide sufficient insulation to prevent further char damage.

Current platforms are limited by the timeframe required for generating a result and by the limited sequence information provided on pathogens. To overcome these limitations PATHSEEK, a 42-month project, proposes to set up a disruptive diagnostic technological pathogen sequencing platform that will deliver in 24-48H, all possible drug resistance mutation as well as data on nosocomial infection, from one patient sample in one single assay. The PATHSEEK platform will open up a new era in clinical diagnosis and patient management by delivering, in one to two days, all the results needed to provide personalized treatment. The rapid delivery of results will ensure early, appropriate therapy thereby helping to reduce the development of drug- resistance and minimizing unnecessary, extra medical expense from the use of inappropriate drugs. Through its multiplex, ultra-deep sequencing capabilities, the platform will also impact public health management of nosocomial infections. At the local level, it will provide, in a simple and efficient manner, all data to control hospital-acquired infections and identify community clusters and transmission chains. At a larger scale, it will permit European and WHO Reference centres to follow, in real time, the spread of infection, allowing earlier interventions to mitigate pandemics.To achieve automated high coverage deep sequencing of any pathogens directly from clinical material for timely identification of drug resistance and outbreaks, PATHSEEK will develop a user-friendly diagnostic platform based on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). PATHSEEK will overcome real and perceived barriers to the use of NGS for routine microbiology, by the innovative inclusion of customized, automated targeted-enrichment of pathogen nucleic acid prior to sequencing. This will improve the sensitivity and specificity of NGS methods for pathogen sequencing. Together with state of the art bench-top sequencing machines and novel bioinformatics tools to facilitate interpretation of results, these measures will provide rapid, personalized results, which are appropriate to real-life diagnostic workflows and clinical needs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed platform in clinical diagnostic settings, the consortium has selected eight key pathogens whose characteristics include a clear unmet clinical and public health need and/or for which the threat is of global importance.

Now is the right moment to tackle this question as for the first time we have genomic technologies and computational abilities to generate the necessary quantitative data and to build computational models describing spatiotemporal coordination of transcription of hundreds of inflammatory genes by multiple TFs. To implement this objective, we have assembled a consortium of top-level scientists in the European Research Area who reached documented excellence in complementary aspects of transcriptional control, namely quantitative measurement of TF-DNA interactions, in vitro and in vivo analysis of chromatin organization, manipulation of genomic sequences by homologous recombination, computational and systems biology applied to transcriptional circuits. The network provides the critical mass required to generate ample quantitative and complementary datasets describing the minimal transcriptional regulatory blocks relevant for inflammation, thus enabling the integration of their coordinated activities via systems approaches.
