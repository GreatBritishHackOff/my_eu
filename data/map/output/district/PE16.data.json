In an era of increasing emergence of drug resistance (EDR) and lack of new antibiotics, old off- patent antibiotics are increasingly being prescribed to patients. However, many of these were developed in an age before the advent of a structured process for drug assessment and approval, and the establishment of clinical efficacy and effectiveness in randomized controlled trials in particular. In a multidisciplinary approach the exposure response relationships for each antibiotic will be elucidated by including pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and microbiological studies, including emergence of drug resistance (EDR). The project addresses the optimization of treatment of infections caused by MDR pathogens that impose a major burden of disease in Europe and the rest of the world by selecting 5 off-patent-antibiotics that are increasingly being used without clear evidence with respect to their effectiveness, duration of therapy and issues of EDR. In the first trial the efficacy of colistin alone is compared to colistin plus imipenem for severe infections caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria. The second trial compares fosfomycin vs. nitrofurantoin for the treatment of lower urinary tract infection in women at high risk of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In the third trial antimicrobial oral treatment with minocycline plus rifampicin is compared with oral treatment with linezolid for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) due to MRSA. Exposure \u2013 response relationships, PK/PD and EDR issues will be addressed in a separate project component and is an essential element of the research project that will interrelate synergistically with the clinical studies. The results thereof will be used to refine exposure response relationships but also to study effects of exposure that are not readily observed in the trials. This will aid to delineate optimal exposures and drug dosing. This project addresses an urgent medical need that is critical both for individual patients and for society. An effective dissemination strategy is essential to effectively communicate project results to the target groups therefore supporting the project goal of preserving and strengthening the public health benefits of the studied off-patent antibiotics. The dissemination of project results to professional groups and the public in general, communication to policymakers, and implementation of results in national formularies is an important aspect.", 1072863.0, 6313719.0, "AIDA", "Putting old antibiotics to the test", "The past few years have seen an increase in the prescription of old, off-patent antibiotics to tackle the emerging drug resistance. To assess the efficacy of these old drugs under new standards, a European study is conducting randomised controlled clinical trials.", "Antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pose an ongoing health hazard during hospitalisation, hampering the effective treatment of many diseases. The combined lack of novel antibiotics has urged clinicians to resort to old compounds that haven\u2019t been subjected to stringent efficacy and toxicity testing procedures.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.aida-project.eu (AIDA) project will perform preclinical and clinical trials to test the efficacy of off-patent antibiotics. Consortium partners will focus on five such drugs (colistin, fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, minocyclin and rifampicin) that are increasingly being used. Using a multidisciplinary approach, they aim to perform pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and microbiological studies to elucidate the exposure-response relationships for each antibiotic.\n\nThe first trial will screen the efficacy of colistin for severe infections caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria. The second trial will concentrate on antibiotics for the treatment of lower urinary tract infections in women while the third trial will deal with oral treatment of skin and soft tissue infections due to MRSA.\n\nDuring these trials, team members will measure and optimise various parameters relating to antibiotic use including exposures and drug dosing. The emergence of drug resistance will be evaluated concomitantly in preclinical and clinical studies by obtaining population resistance profiles and correlates with exposures.\n\nAIDA clinicians collaborated closely with the primary investigators of the concurrent NIH trial in the US. This helped them set up patient inclusion criteria and devise a specific trial protocol. Comparative or cumulative analysis in the future will ensure that a worldwide conclusion is reached and common measures are taken globally.\n\nEvaluation of off-patent antibiotics under stringent conditions will ensure their safe and appropriate administration in the future. Dissemination through media exposure and international conferences will ensure that the project goals, activities and results are communicated to stakeholders and the general public alike.", null, "http://www.micron-group.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/144094.jpg", "fp7_101361_968816019"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PE16"}
