The photonics industry in Europe accounted for revenues of \u20ac49 billion in 2006, and is expected to soon exceed that of microelectronics. In the training network proposed here, a cohort of 14 early stage researchers and 5 young experienced researchers will be trained in the full gamut of skills required for a career in photonics, including materials growth, device fabrication, characterisation, design, theory, and commercialisation. A carefully-chosen, well-balanced consortium of 9 academic partners, 4 full industry partners and 2 associated partners are well placed to provide the training in these skills, with European and worldwide reputations as leaders in each field. These skills will be applied in four application areas; mode-locked lasers for Communications applications, solar cells for Energy applications, gas sensing for Environment applications, and fast tunable laser sources for OCT in Life Science applications. Each researcher will experience both academic and commercial environments thanks to the strong industrial involvement, resulting in multi-skilled, industry-focused graduates.

A European training network has been established to help equip a new generation of researchers with skills in the field.", "Given that photonics deals with the generation and manipulation of light, it is appropriate that this cutting-edge field has become a beacon of European success with ever-brighter prospects ahead. Already, in 2006, the sector was worth EUR\u00a049\u00a0billion in revenues, and the potential to exceed microelectronics in the coming years.\n\nIn light of this potential, photonics is recognised by the EU as a http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/photonics/kets_en.html (key enabling technology) that drives innovation. However, one key challenge remaining for the sector is the shortage of qualified personnel, as identified by the European Technology Platform http://www.photonics21.org/ (Photonics21).\n\n'Postgraduate research on photonics as an enabling technology' (PROPHET) is an EU-financed Initial Training Network (ITN) project helping to fill this skills shortage. The project is training 14 early-stage researchers (ESRs) and 5 young but experienced researchers.\n\nWith support from the People sub-programme of the EU's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), the PROPHET consortium comprises nine partners from academia, four from industry and two associated partners. It is furnishing the participating fellows with a whole spectrum of relevant know-how: growth and fabrication, structural and device characterisation and theory, instrument assembly, as well as industrial applications.\n\nWith input from both academia and industry, fellows are also gaining experience in how to leverage and apply fundamental knowledge, particularly in the areas of communications, energy, environment and life science.\n\nThe project has made significant headway towards its goals in all the identified areas. When PROPHET winds up at the end of 2014, its fellows will be able to go out into the world and become apostles for the new science.", null, "http://www.procal.com", "/docs/results/images/2013-09/56323.jpg", "fp7_97961_972976446"], ["3EA", "Future Superconducting Magnet Technology", "Tesla Engineering Limited", "The CERN\u2019s projects, HL-LHC and FCC, will create a big push in the state of the art of High-Field Superconducting magnets in the ten coming years.

At the same time, in the context of Energy\u2019s savings, Industry is experiencing a renewed interest in the domain of industrial superconductivity with fault current limiters, wind generators, electric energy storage, etc. Besides, Medical Research shows a strong interest in High-Field MRI, especially for the brain observation. Considering the social impact of the investment of the HL-LHC project and FCC study, CERN and CEA have established a Working Group on Future Superconducting Magnet Technology (FuSuMaTech).The Working Group has explored a large spectrum of possible synergies with Industry, and has proposed a set of relevant R&D&I projects to be conducted between Academia and industry. To keep the leading position of Europe in the domain, the most efficient way is to support joint activities of Industry and academic partners on the common concerns in view of overcoming the technological barriers. The FuSuMaTech Initiative aims to create the frame of collaborations and to provide common tools to all the EU actors of the domain. The FuSuMatech Initiative is a dedicated and large scale silo breaking programme which will create a sustainable European Cluster in applied Superconductivity.

While the design of such an architecture has been addressed by 5G-PPP Phase 1 at a conceptual level, it must be brought into practice in Phase 2. To this end, 5G-MoNArch will (i) evolve 5G-PPP Phase 1 concepts to a fully-fledged architecture, (ii) develop prototype implementations and (iii) apply these prototypes to representative use cases.\n\nApproach: 5G-MoNArch architecture design will combine Phase 1 concepts (such as virtualisation, slicing and orchestration of access and core functions) with three enabling innovations that fill gaps not ad-dressed in Phase 1: (i) inter-slice control and cross-domain management, to enable the coordination across slices and domains, (ii) experiment-driven optimization, to leverage experimental results to design highly performing algorithms, and (iii) cloud-enabled protocol stack, to gain flexibility in the orchestration of virtualised functions.\n\nTestbeds: The devised architecture will be deployed in two testbeds: (i) the sea port, representative of a vertical industry use case, and (ii) the touristic city, representative of a mobile operator deployment. For each testbed, 5G-MoNArch will instantiate the architecture and complement it with a use case specific functionality \u2013 the two functional innovations of 5G-MoNArch: (i) resilience and security, needed to meet the sea port requirements, and (ii) resource elasticity, to make an efficient use of the resources in the touristic city. \n\nImpact: 5G-MoNArch has a very high potential for commercial impact, including enhanced products (e.g., orchestrators or edge-cloud RAN), novel services (enabled by network slicing) and opportunities for new market players.

The architecture is enabling unprecedented levels of network customisability, ensuring stringent performance, security, cost and energy requirements to be met; as well as providing an API-driven architectural openness, fuelling economic growth through over-the-top innovation. With 5G NORMA, leading players in the mobile ecosystem aim to underpin Europe\u2019s leadership position in 5G.\nRelevant to strands 'Radio network architecture and technologies' and 'Convergence beyond last mile', the 5G NORMA architecture will provide the necessary adaptability able to efficiently handle the diverse requirements and traffic demand fluctuations resulting from heterogeneous and changing service portfolios. Not following the \u2018one system fits all services\u2019 paradigm of current architectures, 5G NORMA will allow for adapting the mechanisms executed for a given service to the specific service requirements, resulting in a novel service- and context-dependent adaptation of network functions paradigm.\nThe technical approach is based on the innovative concept of adaptive (de)composition and allocation of mobile network functions, which flexibly decomposes the mobile network functions and places the resulting functions in the most appropriate location. By doing so, access and core functions no longer (necessarily) reside in different locations, which is exploited to jointly optimize their operation when possible. The adaptability of the architecture is further strengthened by the innovative software-defined mobile network control and mobile multi-tenancy concepts, and underpinned by corroborating demonstrations.\n5G NORMA will ensure economic sustainability of network operation and open opportunities for new players, while leveraging the efficiency of the architecture to do so in a cost- and energy- effective way.", 490582.0, 6470125.0, "5G NORMA", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_197342_935339282"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4XB", "REAL WIRELESS LIMITED*", 498309.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_3751", 2017], ["3EA", "TESLA ENGINEERING LIMITED*", 51463.0, "Strengthening research in future and emerging technologies (09.04.01.01)", "fts_2017_30156", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "RH20"}
