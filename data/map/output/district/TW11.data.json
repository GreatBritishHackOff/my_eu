In order to realise this aim we need to develop 2 separate but interdependent systems.\n1.\tThe first is an Active Vessel Traffic Management and Information System, or A-VTMIS [Stateczny, 2005]. The idea of which is to take the state of the art in VTMIS which is a passive system providing information and advisories and use this as a basis to actively manage the transit of all vessels in the jurisdiction of the VTMIS. The A-VTMIS must plan provably safe paths for multiple vessels as they arrive from the entrance to the harbour to their berths and ensure that the vessels follow these paths safely without conflicting with the paths of other vessels.\n2.\tThe second system is a pilot aid (SafePilot) which will ensure that crew or harbour pilot can safely and efficiently navigate the courses provided by the A-VTMIS and execute precision docking manoeuvres for large vessels\nIn order to achieve these objectives the accuracy, reliability and SoL aspects of EGNOS are critical. The combination of the accuracy, the availability of the integrity function, and the availability of a single standardised service offer at all European Ports mean that we will be able to develop an A-VTMIS which will be capable of  planning and managing efficient and safe paths for multiple vessels. Additionally, the implementation of authentication mechanisms to support identification and safe recognition of assets in the Maritime operations (e.g. Cargo, ships, vehicles, etc.) as complementary to the SiS authentication provided by SoL services is essential for safety-related operations.

But predominantly it enables higher energy conversion efficiency by ensuring that prime movers are effectively loaded at all times and across all operating conditions. This dominating advantage cannot be matched by mechanical transmission systems because gearboxes offer little chance of integrating a high number of prime movers in the restricted space of a ship whereas this integration is straight forward when managed electrically. Thus the electric ship concept offers reduced emissions through improved efficiency of engine operation but critically it offers significant reduced emissions during the critical phase of entry to littoral water when with speed generally reduced engines in a mechanical systems become very lightly loaded.\n\n\n\nIt is proposed to enhance the electric ship concept so it suits a wider range of vessels than currently. The principal barrier to adoption of the electric ship concept in merchant ships is the size of the equipment. However if size reductions can be achieved then adopting the electric ship concept in a wider range of merchant ships will, as described above, reduce emissions and improve the impact on global warming. Overall this impact will be significant given the current and anticipated levels of global trade and the proportion to be moved by sea transport.\n\n\n\nThis challenging ambition, to enable the adoption of the electric ship concept in a wider range of merchant ships, will demand the development of new technologies across all of marine electrical engineering:\n\n\n\n1.

GETAWAY will tackle this problem through the design and development of an Intelligent Active Dynamic Signage System (IADSS).  Through the introduction of lit, flashing and running signs, the traditional static emergency sign will transformed into a Dynamic Signage System.  The increased affordance offered by the DSS will significantly increase the detectability of the emergency exit sign.  By linking the DSS to the alarm system, the DSS will only be activated when needed, thereby overcoming the \u2018learnt irrelevance\u2019 of emergency signs.  Finally, the Active Dynamic Signage System will be linked to an automated system utilising evacuation simulation, CCTV footage and Fire Detection System information to determine the optimal evacuation route as the fire develops, bringing Intelligence to the ADSS.  IADSS enables the terminal Incident Manager to direct passengers to the optimal egress route by activating the appropriate signs within the ADSS.  The IADSS will be tested and validated through trials in the London Underground and Barcelona Metro.

Optical atomic clocks will thus supersede Cesium (Cs)-based clocks, which 'tick' at microwave frequency, about 10 billion times per second.\n\nIn so-called lattice optical atomic clocks, cold atoms are drawn into a laser wave in form of a standing wave (optical lattice). Herein, thousands of atoms are confined simultaneously. By tuning the lattice laser light to a carefully determined wavelength, its effects on the electron transitions can be minimised.

Commercial honey processing currently uses pasteurisation equipment (often with a vacuum applied) to flash-heat the honey to dissolve the micro-crystals and remove air bubbles, and thus delay crystallisation to 12 months post-processing.

However, increasing operating temperatures compromise the performance and reliability of other components in the power electronic system, including capacitors and inductors, interconnects and packaging, and therefore  complex cooling systems are required which adds complexity and volume to the device design.\n\nThis proposal directly addresses the specific technological challenges of the Call JTI-CS-2013-03-SGO-02-087 entitled \u201cTechnology development and fabrication of high-temperature high-frequency capacitors for power switch integration\u201d, in which a thorough programme of work is proposed to develop optimized ceramic formulation and fabrication to provide highly reliable multilayer ceramic capacitors for high-temperature high-frequency capacitors for power switch integration.\n\nThe 24 month project will use as its base a new high-K ceramic material (SBFT - Strontium-Bismuth-Ferrum-Titanate) which extends power electronics operating temperature up to 200 C. The SBFT ceramic capacitor is characterized by a low thermal coefficient of capacitance (TCC) of less than 25% up to 200 C.

These group will then act as dissemination factor within the whole association.\r\n\r\nThe strategy adopted by AIPD to deal with safety at work within this project foresees the following activities:\r\n  -  Desk analysis and Internet research on safety at work of workers with DS.\r\n  -  Contacts  and agreement with European and foreign organisations working in this field.\r\n  -  Preparation of the participant staff in the concerned matters, by the means of materials and resources provided by partners.\r\n  -  5 days  study visit to UK organisations dealing with job placement of people with DS and especially experienced in safety at work issues.\r\n  -  Evaluation of the experience and diffusion within AIPD and EDSA, the European Down Syndrome Association, which AIPD currently holds the positions of the Presidency.\r\n\r\nFollow up of the project envisaged should be the draft of national guidelines of safety issues at work addressed to workers with DS, possibly in collaboration with the Italian Institute for safety at work (INAIL) .", "http://www.downs-syndrome.org.uk ", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005769_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["0LY", "LGC LIMITED*LGC", 400.0, "Other management expenditure (05.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_16756", 2016], ["8QE", "TEARFUND LBG*", 706347.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2016_24594", 2016], ["0LY", "LGC LIMITED*LGC", 220.0, "Provision of services and work on behalf of outside bodies (10.04.02)", "fts_2016_60805", 2016], ["0LW", "NPL MANAGEMENT LIMITED*", 28090.0, "Euratom activities of direct research (10.03.01)", "fts_2016_63098", 2016], ["0LY", "LGC LIMITED*LGC", 220.0, "Scientific and technical support for Union policies on a competitive basis (10.04.03)", "fts_2016_68750", 2016], ["8LZ", "BMT GROUP LTD*", 8147.0, "Completion of previous research framework programmes (prior to 2007) (09.04.52)", "fts_2016_72677", 2016], ["0LY", "LGC LIMITED*LGC", 3501.0, "Other management expenditure (05.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_74001", 2016], ["8LZ", "BMT GROUP LTD*", 1060925.0, "Achieving a European transport system that is resource-efficient, environmentally friendly, safe and seamless (08.02.03.04)", "fts_2017_5166", 2017], ["0LW", "NPL MANAGEMENT LIMITED*", 392510.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_7938", 2017], ["0LW", "NPL MANAGEMENT LIMITED*", 235452.0, "Leadership in nanotechnologies, advanced materials, laser technology, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing (08.02.02.01)", "fts_2017_10018", 2017], ["0LW", "NPL MANAGEMENT LIMITED*", 292204.0, "Leadership in nanotechnologies, advanced materials, laser technology, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing (08.02.02.01)", "fts_2017_10323", 2017], ["0LW", "NPL MANAGEMENT LIMITED*", 238376.0, "Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions \u2014 generating, developing and transferring new skills, knowledge and innovation (15.03.01.01)", "fts_2017_11143", 2017], ["0LW", "NPL MANAGEMENT LIMITED*", 165070.0, "Euratom \u2014 Nuclear fission and radiation protection (08.03.01.02)", "fts_2017_11460", 2017], ["0LW", "NPL MANAGEMENT LIMITED*", 243140.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_12128", 2017], ["0LW", "NPL MANAGEMENT LIMITED*", 341813.0, "Strengthening research in future and emerging technologies (09.04.01.01)", "fts_2017_13285", 2017], ["0LY", "LGC LIMITED*LGC", 248.0, "Other management expenditure (05.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_18618", 2017], ["0LW", "NPL MANAGEMENT LIMITED*", 1308379.0, "Strengthening frontier research in the European Research Council (08.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_19157", 2017], ["0LW", "NPL MANAGEMENT LIMITED*", 170486.0, "Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions \u2014 generating, developing and transferring new skills, knowledge and innovation (15.03.01.01)", "fts_2017_40891", 2017], ["0LY", "LGC LIMITED*LGC", 341.0, "Horizon 2020 \u2014 Customer-driven scientific and technical support to Union policies (10.02.01)", "fts_2017_57351", 2017], ["0LY", "LGC LIMITED*LGC", 237.0, "Scientific and technical support for Union policies on a competitive basis (10.04.03)", "fts_2017_68638", 2017]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["0JL", "RAX", "TEDDINGTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL"], ["0JL", "RJ7", "ST.
