We wish to improve our early years provision in order to ensure more than expected progress is made by children in early years. Having established networks and gained knowledge and confidence from local schools, we wish to learn from different early years provisions on an international stage, starting with provision in Italy (particularly the Reggio Emilia approach) and then learning from a Swedish approach, in order to triangulate comparisons.Our objectives are to increase the knowledge of our early years staff and senior leadership team in order to raise attainment; to evaluate current practice in our school by comparison with provision in Italy and Sweden; to improve confidence amongst less experienced early years staff with a view to growing future leaders and finally to establish links for collaborative learning projects with European schools for our early years and Key Stage 1 classes (since we currently only hold a KS2 connection with a school in Brazil).We hope to involve twelve participants: three members of the senior leadership team and nine teachers of varying experience for an initial flow in early 2017 to Italy. We hope to send a further flow of participants in early 2018 to Sweden; the same staff as the initial flow.During the courses in Italy and Sweden we hope to deepen knowledge and understanding amongst the following areas (but not limited to): an understanding of the Italian and Swedish educational systems from early years through to UK secondary level; how to ensure quality provision; regional evaluative systems; the management of early years providers; the organizational structure and the professional profiles involved in the educational process in public and private schools; documentation; outdoor education; valorization of mother tongues; parental involvement; networking with municipal and regional pedagogical coordinators ECEC; continuity between early years and primary level and creative teaching practices.We intend to send the same participants in order to ensure a rich understanding amongst our early years staff of two very different approaches to ours in early years teaching. We hope through deepening understanding over a two year period with the same staff, we will be able to trial new, best practice from an international setting with two separate cohorts in our early years, whilst also broadening the teaching practice of our staff substantially. Thanks to this, we hope the children will profit from an enriched start, serving them well as they grow older and progress through the school.We will initially attend a course in Italy on early childhood education and care, conducted by a reputable provider which has acquired a prominent position in Italy in the field of EU projects on early childhood education.

Collaborative learning projects with EU partner schools visited as part of the courses will have been established. All adults involved in early years education at St. James' will have a broader knowledge of provision and our school development plan will have been reviewed and amended accordingly.Potential longer term benefits include the children at St. James' making more than expected progress throughout their primary school career, creating new knowledge within our school, but also disseminating international best practice amongst existing networks our school already has with other local providers.", "http://www.stjamesschoolbermondsey.com", "St. James' CE Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023403_coordinator"], ["6AT", "La educaci\u00f3n inclusiva para una escuela del siglo XXI", "Bacon's College", 9117.0, "CPR Padre Feijoo-Zorelle is a co-educational privately run school in Ourense, funded by the State for ages 3-16. Our main aim is to provide students with the knowledge and skills required by the labour market and the economy, while allowing them to play an active role in society and achieve personal fulfilment. Special emphasis is placed on autonomy since this skill proves to be essential for the successful completion of all the educational stages.  \r\nThis project could have a very significant impact on the achievement of our main aim because it constitutes an excellent opportunity to exchange knowledge and experience with professionals from other EU countries. This, is turn, would improve our staff\u2019s professional competence and guarantee our school quality and international projection. \r\nHaving analyzed the sociocultural and academic background of our school community, 4 areas for improvement have been identified, which are included in our European Development Program and suggested in the project\u2019s title: \u201cInclusive Education for a 21st-century School\u201d. \u201cInclusive education\u201d refers to 2 of the areas identified, namely: the need to 1) improve school management and the quality of our education so as to achieve 2) a more cohesive school community in which the inclusion of sociocultural diversity and individual talents would be more effective. 40.30% of our students belong to families from 21 different countries. Besides, one can find a high degree of diversity among students in terms of abilities and talents, a diversity derived from factors related to situations of socio-economic (dis)advantage, linguistic compensation and learning disorders. An improvement of school management will definitely enhance inclusive education. In this respect, our point of departure is a solid system of measures to support teachers, students and families, which we aim to develop by exploring and creating new measures of mutual support. \u201cA 21st century school\u201d refers to the two other areas for improvement: the need to 3) improve teachers\u2019 professional and linguistic competences and to 4) foster internationalization and a sense of belonging to the EU. Our teaching team is highly qualified thanks to an annual plan of permanent training. As a result of this, we have successfully implemented a methodological approach based on the acquisition of key skills through tasks and projects and on Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL). In the light of this approach, we have developed interdisciplinary multilingual projects praised as innovative educational practices by specialized publications. 5 of this projects have been developed on eTwinning, a platform which has played a key role in the selection of project partners. As regards internationalization, this project will enable us to reinforce cooperation with schools we have already collaborated with through eTwinning and to get in touch with other schools for future international projects. The benefit derived from this will be double: we will import good practices and will export our own, an exchange which will greatly improve teaching skills and inclusion at our school while reinforcing a sense of belonging a union of countries characterized by its value and preservation of cultural diversity. \r\nThe selection of participants and mobility actions has been determined by the aforementioned areas of improvement. The project will last 1 academic year; 4 to 6 teachers will participate in a total number of 7 mobility activities. 3 of these activities will be job shadowing experiences in schools in different countries (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom). Every participant will import good practices related to teaching, assessment, management and attention to diversity. This same teacher will export our practices and will invite the school to collaborate in our Postcrossing project. The 4 other mobility activities are training courses in the United Kingdom (2), Finland and Sweden, which deal with school management, foreign language teaching, innovative teaching and inclusive education, respectively. The project will also have a deep impact on the school community and on schools not directly participating in the project thanks to the dissemination of tangible and intangible results by means of meetings, seminars, workshops and regular publications online and in the press. With a view to integrate the project\u2019s achievements in our strategic future, we will take part in conferences and training courses to share our project\u2019s impact and to enlarge our network of potential partners.

We are an increasingly popular school and have received a bulge class to accommodate the growing need for places within the borough. We have high expectations of our pupils and are not complacent.  We are constantly striving to improve what we do.  Our children achieve well in relation to national expectations at Expected levels  at KS2.  However, our school priority remains to increase the numbers of children attaining higher levels, especially disadvantaged pupils.  Many of our children have very low attainment levels on entry and we have a broad range of provision on offer to support those children who are working below age-related expectations. However we would like to match the quality of provision on offer for higher ability pupils to what is already offered to their less able peers.  We are always keen to share best practice and to learn from the practice of others.  To this end to date we have worked collaboratively with a large number of  Southwark schools. We have helped these schools to organise their visits to us, to ensure they meet their objectives and stay within their budgets.  We are committed to sharing best practice with other schools and do this already through providing courses, visits and consultancy.  Having a more European perspective would enable us to better offer this kind of support to other schools. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop a greater awareness of what international schools are doing and for participants to learn from these schools best practice in order to raise the attainment and aspirations of our more able pupils, especially those who are disadvantaged.  Furthermore, as stated in our school improvement plan we wish to develop and promote a more creative and entrepreneurial curriculum. This project will allow us to send 28 teachers from across the school (including school leaders) to four European Countries (Norway, Sweden, Italy and Spain) to observe good practice with a view to implementing more effective strategies and to developing opportunities for the children in our classrooms to connect with children in the classrooms of other European countries.
