Diet shifts and rising populations to 9.5 billion, by 2050, will see meat and fish demand increase by over 70% globally. Agri-food industries need a new sustainable source of protein as current methods of protein feed production will fall short by 60 million tonnes by 2030. Technology for automation of insect-protein production is a key industry priority as current rearing methods are not conducive to industrial scale production. Entocycle combines 150 million years of natural R&D perfection with high tech engineering to mass produce H. illucens, revolutionising the industrial production of insect-protein. Entocycle is building on expertise in H. illucens life cycle optimisation, developing the proprietary technology to efficiently breed and raise the insects in automated modular units, utilising Machine Learning and AI capabilities through partnerships with IBM and the European Space Agency. Entocycle will provide a high quality insect-protein feed to the aquaculture and livestock sector through the bioconversion of organic waste from agri-food industries, 88 million tonnes of which are created annually in Europe alone. Entocycle\u2019s technology converts waste treatment costs into new revenue streams, producing lipids, chitin and fertilizer as by-products. Having partnered with Tesco, Entocycle has secured a direct route to market within their supply chain.

Our main aim is to provide students with the knowledge and skills required by the labour market and the economy, while allowing them to play an active role in society and achieve personal fulfilment. Special emphasis is placed on autonomy since this skill proves to be essential for the successful completion of all the educational stages.  \r\nThis project could have a very significant impact on the achievement of our main aim because it constitutes an excellent opportunity to exchange knowledge and experience with professionals from other EU countries. This, is turn, would improve our staff\u2019s professional competence and guarantee our school quality and international projection. \r\nHaving analyzed the sociocultural and academic background of our school community, 4 areas for improvement have been identified, which are included in our European Development Program and suggested in the project\u2019s title: \u201cInclusive Education for a 21st-century School\u201d. \u201cInclusive education\u201d refers to 2 of the areas identified, namely: the need to 1) improve school management and the quality of our education so as to achieve 2) a more cohesive school community in which the inclusion of sociocultural diversity and individual talents would be more effective. 40.30% of our students belong to families from 21 different countries. Besides, one can find a high degree of diversity among students in terms of abilities and talents, a diversity derived from factors related to situations of socio-economic (dis)advantage, linguistic compensation and learning disorders. An improvement of school management will definitely enhance inclusive education. In this respect, our point of departure is a solid system of measures to support teachers, students and families, which we aim to develop by exploring and creating new measures of mutual support. \u201cA 21st century school\u201d refers to the two other areas for improvement: the need to 3) improve teachers\u2019 professional and linguistic competences and to 4) foster internationalization and a sense of belonging to the EU. Our teaching team is highly qualified thanks to an annual plan of permanent training. As a result of this, we have successfully implemented a methodological approach based on the acquisition of key skills through tasks and projects and on Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL). In the light of this approach, we have developed interdisciplinary multilingual projects praised as innovative educational practices by specialized publications. 5 of this projects have been developed on eTwinning, a platform which has played a key role in the selection of project partners. As regards internationalization, this project will enable us to reinforce cooperation with schools we have already collaborated with through eTwinning and to get in touch with other schools for future international projects. The benefit derived from this will be double: we will import good practices and will export our own, an exchange which will greatly improve teaching skills and inclusion at our school while reinforcing a sense of belonging a union of countries characterized by its value and preservation of cultural diversity. \r\nThe selection of participants and mobility actions has been determined by the aforementioned areas of improvement. The project will last 1 academic year; 4 to 6 teachers will participate in a total number of 7 mobility activities. 3 of these activities will be job shadowing experiences in schools in different countries (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom). Every participant will import good practices related to teaching, assessment, management and attention to diversity. This same teacher will export our practices and will invite the school to collaborate in our Postcrossing project. The 4 other mobility activities are training courses in the United Kingdom (2), Finland and Sweden, which deal with school management, foreign language teaching, innovative teaching and inclusive education, respectively. The project will also have a deep impact on the school community and on schools not directly participating in the project thanks to the dissemination of tangible and intangible results by means of meetings, seminars, workshops and regular publications online and in the press. With a view to integrate the project\u2019s achievements in our strategic future, we will take part in conferences and training courses to share our project\u2019s impact and to enlarge our network of potential partners. Likewise, we will organize teacher training courses based on the 4 aforementioned areas of improvement, on which the project is expected to have a sustainable impact.", "http://www.baconscollege.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-035894_1"], ["2PL", "Rotherhithe Primary School European Professional Development", "Rotherhithe Prmary School", 47745.0, "Rotherhithe is a 3 form entry school in an area of high social deprivation (0.57 compared to 0.24) nationally) in Southwark London. We have high levels of SEN ( 18.2% ) free school meals (62%) and EAL (    46.4% ). We are an increasingly popular school and have received a bulge class to accommodate the growing need for places within the borough. We have high expectations of our pupils and are not complacent.  We are constantly striving to improve what we do.  Our children achieve well in relation to national expectations at Expected levels  at KS2.  However, our school priority remains to increase the numbers of children attaining higher levels, especially disadvantaged pupils.  Many of our children have very low attainment levels on entry and we have a broad range of provision on offer to support those children who are working below age-related expectations. However we would like to match the quality of provision on offer for higher ability pupils to what is already offered to their less able peers.  We are always keen to share best practice and to learn from the practice of others.  To this end to date we have worked collaboratively with a large number of  Southwark schools. We have helped these schools to organise their visits to us, to ensure they meet their objectives and stay within their budgets.  We are committed to sharing best practice with other schools and do this already through providing courses, visits and consultancy.  Having a more European perspective would enable us to better offer this kind of support to other schools. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop a greater awareness of what international schools are doing and for participants to learn from these schools best practice in order to raise the attainment and aspirations of our more able pupils, especially those who are disadvantaged.  Furthermore, as stated in our school improvement plan we wish to develop and promote a more creative and entrepreneurial curriculum. This project will allow us to send 28 teachers from across the school (including school leaders) to four European Countries (Norway, Sweden, Italy and Spain) to observe good practice with a view to implementing more effective strategies and to developing opportunities for the children in our classrooms to connect with children in the classrooms of other European countries. We would  offer the opportunity for the schools we visit to undertake return visits to us.  20 teachers will be split into 4 groups of 5 accompanied by  2 senior leaders with each group visiting one of the four countries.  We already have links with schools in Sweden, Italy and Spain and will seek through   professional relationships with partner schools to organise links in Norway. On returning from each trip the group will share their findings with the leadership team and phase leaders and the information will be evaluated and action plans developed, then shared with the teaching staff, intervention teachers and teaching assistants, in order to drive improvement. At the end of the project we will compare and evaluate the results and draw conclusions that will support us to improve our own practice and that we can share with other schools in our borough and more widely.\r\n\r\nThe course will include:\r\nA visit to the education department in the district visited to learn about national, regional and local education systems.\r\nVisits to a number of local schools to observe practice, talk to practitioners and see the strategies being used on the ground.\r\nVisits to museums, businesses, and cultural attractions that the schools in the area use to support and enhance curricula. \r\nReturn visit to the education department to discuss and evaluate our findings and prepare for the dissemination of this information to staff in our schools and more widely.\r\nThe aims of this project are that staff will:\r\nDevelop a greater awareness of international education systems, including similarities to and differences from our own education system.\r\nBe motivated and stimulated to try out new ideas and adopt new practice.\r\nTo be more confident in supporting others to develop their practice.\r\nUse an increasing number of and a more varied and effective range of strategies for supporting more able pupils to develop a more creative curriculum that promotes entrepreneurial mindsets.\r\nBe more confident about sharing good practice, within the school and across the borough and other schools nationally.\r\nIn addition, we believe the project will help us to build and extend opportunities for our children to communicate with their European counterparts (eg collaborative projects, exchanges, penpals, skype)\r\nThese aims will be achieved by the end of the project and in the longer term shared with others.", "http://www.rotherhitheprimaryschool.co.uk", "Rotherhithe Prmary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036031_coordinator"], ["4DG", "Smash Borders, Build Solidarity!", "Young Greens of England and Wales", 31158.0, "The global refugee situation completely reshaped the political landscape in Europe and beyond its borders.

Recent events, however, also revealed acceptance and willingness to help on a scale that no one would have anticipated. Overwhelming cases of solidarity prove that European society is ready for a radical transformation into an open, compassionate one, which doesn\u2019t leave people in need behind.\r\n\r\nFederation of Young European Greens (FYEG) and its partner organisations have been on the forefront of solidarity actions across Europe, however, it is now time for a unified resistance towards the fear that is planted and nourished by the racist and xenophobic groups. \r\n\r\nIn this spirit, FYEG will gather 50 young people for a seminar called \u201cSmash Borders - Build Solidarity!\u201c. With this project we aim to raise awareness on different dimensions of migration and asylum policies and develop strategies to eradicate hateful rhetoric in public sphere delivered by the far-right movements and political groups. The activities in the programme will qualify the participants within the context of intercultural learning and stimulate them to develop and adopt new skills concerning the topics of migration and inclusion of migrants. The training promotes pedagogical approaches in dealing with challenges and opportunities in multicultural and pluralistic societies and empowers the participants to work on reflective competences and tools for social change. \r\n\r\nThe project aims: \r\nTo increase the understanding of the legal framework on migration, in order to identify discrepancies between the general framework of human rights and particularly conventions and agreements, and implementation of actual practices on European level.\r\nParticipants to develop their own strategies, political and practical solutions to the current refugee crisis, towards building more inclusive society in the spirit of European solidarity.\r\nTo equip participants with arguments and communications skills to counteract the far-right discourse on migration.\r\nTo create common narrative and develop coordinated actions between young green organisations and other civil society actors to battle violent extremism and far-right movements locally and across Europe\r\n\r\nGenderly and geographically balanced group of participants will consist of youth workers from 12 young green organisation.
