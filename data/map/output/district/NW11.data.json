The objective of Wikirate is to be the 'go-to' place for information on companies' social and environmental practices, allowing consumers and stakeholders such as policymakers or the media to be better informed. Ultimately, the project will provide companies with additional incentive to act sustainably.We will achieve this by developing and maintaining an open social networking system that allows Internet users to cooperatively create and share knowledge on company behaviour. The information may come from public sources, or from 'sensors' such as webcams or individual user uploads of videos or images or from separate whistleblowing websites \u2013 a real-time gathering and management of information from people and their environment. The information will be accumulated and appropriately visualized on the website to allow users to compare and rate such companies.We will foster and empower the community to act on sustainability topics such as climate change or natural resource management and specific markets or companies. This thriving community will create relevant and quality content. Further, these engaged and involved users will change their behaviours, providing significant incentive for companies to follow sustainable societal, environmental and economic methods.The website will be based on an open-source software platform called 'Wagn', and any improvements to the platform will be freely available. Further, we will offer an open data infrastructure by supporting an application programming interface (API) that allows anyone to access the website's data.", 37187.0, 1859726.0, "Wikirate", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110681_949247918"], ["9RS", "Envisioning an advanced ICT-supported build-up of manufacturing skills for the Factories of the Future", "Highskillz Limited", "The main aim of ManuSkills is to study the use of enhanced ICT-based technologies and training methodologies to facilitate an increase of young talent interest in manufacturing and to support their training of new manufacturing skills.The project will experiment with a wide range of innovative delivery mechanisms such as serious games and teaching factory, supported by the use of social media augmented by gamification and leveraging the distribution channels preferred by young talent.

We propose moving from a model in which scientific research, innovation, and problem-solving is mainly driven by scientific/professional institutions to one based on active public participation and capacity building with various levels and strategies of engagement in the scientific process.  At the core of our ethos is a recognition of people's existing expertise and the different ways people want to and do engage in science and technology. The project is aimed at elevating public engagement with science across Europe from passive engagement with the process of developing science to an active one.
