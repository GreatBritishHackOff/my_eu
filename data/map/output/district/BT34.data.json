The idea arose with the objective to develop the incipient supply of active tourism in the Valencian Community stimulating the entrepreneurship from the province of Alicante and thus to create new companies with quality and qualified technicians very linguistically. Our project is coordinated by a Partnership consolidated in the time and with a high degree of quality formed by almost all the educative  public schools of the Valencian Community who have the lessons of the professional Family of Activities physical (14 of 17 schools) and represented by the named Coordinators of mobility the effect by each center/school. In this Partnership also there is a representation of partners who are private educative Schools (3 schools). The Partnership meets once a month during all the life of the project (12 months) to adopt consensual agreements following the directives of the protocols of performances designed throughout 5 made projects E.W.E.\r\n The coordination in all the actions and the work in equipment makes of Y.E.D a clear example that united it is possible to be able successfully to take to the practice a common idea. Our vision of the formation extends beyond the differentiating concepts between public or deprived education, represented the two options in our project. For the Partnership the important thing is the unit since all the educative schools that we distributed the lessons of the professional family of physical activities, as much public as prevailed, we have same the problematic one derived from studies regulated by an educative law of 1995 that has still not been updated. The work profile of the pupils of the professional family represented in this project this directed to the sector of the described active Tourism but due to the problematic one does not receive linguistic formation in another language reason why it is very difficult that they can find an agreed work position to its formation. Our participants are students of professional Formation of average degree of Technician in conduction of sport activities in the nature whose professional 0bjetivo is titular as mountain Guides, equestrian ones and mountain bike. \u201cY.E.D\u201d aspires to being a referring one in the Valencian Community and to transfer its experience to the rest of Spain and to the different countries that form the European Union and for it we will even create through crowdfunding a participating App and frees in where the educative centers/schools can contribute information resisted on partners of welcome of different countries, made experiences, lodgings, etc. and also to use the information contributed by the other members that participate in crowdfunding obtaining a great diffusion and participation. Thanks to the quality of the Spanish professional formation and to the experience in previous projects, Y.E.D. it facilitates to its participants the first work experience remunerated thanks to that 50% of such receive a supply of work on the part of the companies that participate in the project. 105 students and students of ages between the 17 to the 26 years participate in this Erasmus+ project that will make their formative Module of practices (FCT) in companies of four different countries during 3 months: Ireland, North Ireland, France and Malta. These countries have been chosen by their historical trajectory in the development of companies dedicated to the activities of mountain, equestrian, mountain bike and multi-adventure. The accomplishment of this formation will make possible the obtaining to them of its title of Technician in addition to the certifications EUROPASS that will credit the competitions acquired during mobility. In the short and medium term we try to improve and to increase the youthful use in companies of the section of the active tourism and to acquire suitable technical competitions for this type of companies thanks to the capacity to communicate in a foreign language to accede to more customers. Our objective is to foment to mean and long term the entrepreneurship to create new companies thanks to learning by doing acquired in its period FCT.
