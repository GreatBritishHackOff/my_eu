On the one hand, there is at present no system of support or guidance for non-certified trainers and sharers of nonviolent communication (NVC) in the UK; GSE is ideally place to fill this gap with our existing profile and competence as an initiator of innovative training and outreach projects. On the other hand, there is an urgent need to forge and expand national, cross-border and inter-cultural links within the wider NVC community as we face the threat of Brexit and increasing divisions in society. \r\n\r\nOur project objectives therefore center around two strands: to support individual participants to become better trainers and sharers of NVC within their local communities and to strengthen ties between peers in different European countries, both at the new trainer and experienced mentor levels. Bridging these strands is our ever-present focus on human experience as members of a living community rather than as isolated individuals. Participants will have an intense experience of living needs-focused community at a 9 day International Intensive Training (IIT) in Denmark and a continuing experience of it through the inter-group contacts during the rest of the year. Both aspects will feed into the future ability and resourcefulness of our participants to return to their own communities the benefits of the learning they will achieve during the year through a 'cascade' learning model.\r\n\r\nWe have accepted 15 applicants for the project coming from all over the UK, including 5 men, 9 women and one of undefined gender. All are currently sharing NVC in a range of diverse contexts such as education, mental health services, LBGT communities, families and more whilst not having been certified as NVC trainers with CNVC. \r\n\r\nThe activities to be undertaken include monthly Skype calls, face to face meetings at least 3 times in the year,  individual mentoring with GSE staff, regular peer support exchanges, the 9 day residential IIT in Denmark. We will also offer residential weekend trainings in the UK during the course of the year and in the latter part of the project we our project participants will embark on individual dissemination activities including workshops, group facilitation and other NVC related events within their communities and sphere of interest.  In the course of the project, peer support will be central for the development and continuous assessment of individual goals, while mentoring from GSE staff will also be available as required. Group gatherings will be used to celebrate achievements, mourn setbacks and consolidate community involvement. Written evaluations will also form part of the methodology of the project.\r\n\r\nThe key results we expect are a cohort of better equipped and resourced NVC trainers and sharers who are ready to take on leadership roles within the wider NVC community as well as the development of stronger and more resilient networks both within the UK and across borders within which these trainers can continue to develop further.  In the long term this will lead to better and more widespread penetration of nonviolent values and practice in the participants' different spheres of agency, to greater involvement in supporting local communities and to the expansion of the European NVC network.", "http://www.giraffesocialenterprises.org.uk", "Giraffe Social Enterprises CIC", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA104-035665_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SA43"}
