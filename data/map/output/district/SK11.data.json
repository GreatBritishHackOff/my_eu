This is an attractive alternative in alignment with current EC regulations that are demanding a significant reduction in the use of sulphur dioxide in wines.\nA novel continuous pressure change technology system to stabilize wine and wine must with high- pressure (500 bar), was successfully developed and validated at a 120L/h scale. This process provides a \u201ccold pasteurization\u201d process, with the advantage that heat-labile components, colour and taste remain unchanged. The novel PreserveWine system significantly reduced the amount of oxygen in wine, thus providing protection against oxidation directly after treatment and during long-term storage in barrels or bottles. Further positive effects including the protection of wine from colour changes and the maintenance of physicochemical and sensory quality of red and white wine and must be more extensively validated. The effects of various parameters such as gas type and retention time have been determined.\nAn industrial scale unit has been designed and specified.

With over 1,5 Million wine holdings in Europe, we identified a potential market for this system of at least 1% of wine holdings in Europe (150,000 PCT units) This project we will extend prior R&amp;D. PCT is a novel non-thermal technique that involves charging product with pressure and an inert gas and then rapidly releasing the pressure; the sudden pressure release causes microbial cell walls to rupture, inactivating microorganisms. It has been demonstrated on a small pilot scale batch process; in this project we will scientifically validate the process, developing and scaling it up into a continuous in-line pre-industrial demonstrator testing it with wine but to also enable application to other liquid foods.

Often, chemical preservatives are used to maintain the stability and quality of wines, a practice that must now be discontinued in line with new EU regulations. The EU-funded project http://www.preservewine.eu (PRESERVEWINE) set out to conquer this challenge.\n\nInvestigating a promising low-cost, non-thermal process called pressure change technology (PCT) to stabilise wines, the project team worked on a viable alternative to reduce sulphur dioxide use in winemaking. The new technique involves charging and pressurising the wine with an inert gas and then rapidly releasing the pressure, inactivating microorganisms that cause spoilage and providing a protective atmosphere to avoid oxidation.\n\nThe project team successfully developed and validated a PCT system to stabilise wine and wine must. The prototype can process 120\u00a0litres per hour at a pressure of 500\u00a0bars. The team also developed the relevant software and integrated sensors into the system, enabling online monitoring of parameters during wine treatment.\n\nAnother positive outcome was that the new process not only retained the wine's physical and chemical properties, but also preserved the sensory properties of the tested wines. This ensured that the process did not interfere with the wine's delicate balance and that the wine's bouquet remained unchanged. Long-term studies on wine stability and quality will continue during the PRESERVEWINE-Demo project.\n\nArmed with this success, the team demonstrated the PCT system in France's Bordeaux region, famed for its primacy in winemaking. Eventually, once implemented at a large scale, the technology could save as much as 40\u00a0% on energy costs, also replacing additives while contributing to preserving the environment.

In addition, an intelligent process control unit will be developed in order to control the ozone dose and make the treatment system cost effective. To create this technological capability, new scientific knowledge will be acquired and applied to specific development routes.  Marine bio-fouling is a major problem for materials in constant contact with seawater. For vessels, the need for sustainable and cost effective biofouling control technology is growing as existing methods are either inefficient or under environmental scrutiny. The demand for a cost effective and environmentally friendly technology for mitigation of biofoulig on heat exchangers of vessels is particularly gaining ground as accumulation of marine organisms has impact on the proper functioning of engines and other appliances on board that need constant and proper cooling, and on the safety of the vessel. However, the European and global equipment market for equipment needed for mitigation of marine biofouling is dominated by products from Europe\u2019s major global economic partners due to their superior R&D.

Its removal involves the use of expensive techniques such as high-pressure hoses. Biofouling preventive methods such as chlorination of pipe work or anti-fouling coatings are unfortunately accompanied by significant environmental impact.\n\nEfficient operation of a vessel's seawater-based cooling system is compromised when they are obstructed by colonising marine invertebrates and seaweed. The blockage of inlet pipes for cooling water and/or a drop in heat exchange efficiency can cause an increase in the working temperature of engines and other appliances. The result is a possible shorter working life and risk to the vessel's safety.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.biofoulcontrol.com/ (BIOFOULCONTROL) project addressed the problem of biofouling by developing innovative technology that disperses ozone into the cooling water. This has the effect of deactivating the marine organisms that may settle in the cooling system. The ozonation system also minimises the generation of products that are toxic to the marine environment.\n\nAn intelligent control unit was built to monitor the process and manage ozone dosage to ensure the system's optimum operation. The integrated BIOFOULSYSTEM was then installed and tested onboard an offshore supply vessel. The technology can also be applied to other sectors working in the marine environment, such as aquaculture, ocean thermal power generators, offshore platforms and water supply systems.\n\nThe BIOFOULCONTROL project successfully developed a cost-effective, eco-friendly, user-friendly and reliable ozone feeding and dispersion unit to control marine biofouling on heat exchangers of vessels.", "http://www.biofoulcontrol.com", "http://www.statiflo.net", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58250.jpg", "fp7_94936_997331691"], ["6JQ", "Development of sustainable and cost effective water quality management technology for the aquaculture industry", "Statiflo International Ltd", "The proposers of RAZone have identified a new market opportunity in enhancing the productivity of the aquaculture sector and minimizing risks associated with application of ozone for water quality management in hatchery and ongrow farms that use RAS technology.

The innovations of RAZone include novel ozone feeding system that ensures enhanced gas dispersion in water and maximizes contact between gas and water for separation of fine particles and dissolved organics in recirculated water. In addition, the development of RAZone includes innovative flotation chamber where fine particles that make up 70% of suspended substances and dissolved organics are efficiently removed. For optimum dosage of ozone and minimizing risk of stock mortality due to toxicity directly from inefficiently dispersed ozone or from generated by products, an intelligent process control unit will be created.\n\nDespite the recognized potential of ozone in RAS, there remains a significant lack of equipment and knowledge in the industry related to cost effective and safe use of the technology. Application of ozone via protein skimmers has become a costly component of RAS operation due to poorly designed equipment for ozone feeding, inefficient configuration of skimmers and lack of controlled ozone dosage combined with poor understanding of process. This may result in either avoidance of ozone technology altogether or inefficient application to achieve desired aims in addition to associated risks.

Smart actuators and sensors are integrated into modular adaptronic devices that can then be connected (plugged in) to form adaptive smart components (ASCs). The ASCs are elements of a distributed control architecture, with integrated control logic linked to a computer numerical control system.
