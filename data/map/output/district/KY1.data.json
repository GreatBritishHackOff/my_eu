Mobility will comprise 156 mobility VET learners, the majority being apprentices, and 33 accompanying persons who will travel to  Spain, Portugal and Turkey. This may seem like large mobility project but the experience of our staff in European mobility is unparalleled with over 50 years of collective experience in Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+ project management and delivery. \r\n\r\nEvidence from previous mobility projects has shown that success rates for Scottish mobility participants in being offered a professional contract can be dramatically increased through participation in European mobility, with a 2-3 fold increase in the likelihood of apprentices becoming professional footballers. \r\n\r\nAnother value-added benefit of mobility participation is the finding that apprentices who are unsuccessful in being offered a professional contract are significantly more likely to be offered employment in a secondary career pathway than those who have not undertaken mobility. Unemployment among mobility participants is less than 4%, compared to 45% unemployment in peers from other Scottish clubs who have not undertaken mobility. The consequential improvement in informal learning, soft skills, cultural awareness and linguistic abilities as a result of mobility has proven to be a major deciding factor for employers. \r\n\r\nThis mobility project will enhance the employability of Scottish apprentices and allow them to experience the culture, language and training methods at an acknowledged (UEFA) Centre of Excellence, which is applauded as having world class record in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  \r\n\r\nThe project objectives are:\r\n1. Improved tactical, technical, physical and mental competences for participants as a direct result of mobility.\r\n2. Improved employment rates for mobility participants either as a professional footballer or in alternative career pathways.\r\n3. Accreditation and validation of mobility informal learning and soft skills.\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within Europe.\r\n5. A commitment to embed mobility principles within the Modern Apprenticeship Programme.\r\n6. Increased maturity and self-esteem among participants.\r\n7. Dissemination of practices, policies, systems and project outcomes at the employer, local regional and national levels in the UK and in Europe.\r\n8. Incorporation of the project outcomes and best practice within the work and social environments of the project partners.\r\n9. Increase understanding of interconnections between formal and non-formal education.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mobility project will directly strengthen the links between the Scottish Sending partners, European host partners and vocational training providers Scotland through exchange of information at the institutional level and will facilitate the the introduction of innovations in coaching technology to Scottish club academies. Dissemination activities will accelerate the process of mainstreaming the skills and technology transfer from Europe into Scottish vocational education programmes.", "http://www.raithrovers.net", "Adjuvant Limited", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047392_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "KY1"}
