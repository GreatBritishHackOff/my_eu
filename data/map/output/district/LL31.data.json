Furthermore, we find companies demanding prepared young people, as a consequence of the competitiveness misbalance within the European common market that cannot satisfy companies' needs, feeding the EU skills gap.\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome such skills gap of the province, with a strong rural character, the Diputaci\u00f3n has formed a Consortium, with 33 schools of FP in Pontevedra, which will offer 102 young graduates in a cycle of VET of Middle Degree of One of these centres, the possibility of carrying out work practices, for 6 months, in a European company. Participants must return from their mobility within 12 months after obtaining their degree. The international practices will not be part of the FCT but will add value to the practices previously carried out in companies in the province.\r\n\r\nThe participants will also carry out a formative linguistic activity through the online tool \"OLS\", made available for the Programme, for the following languages: English, Italian and Dutch. In the case of participants traveling to Finland, they will take an intensive course of Finnish, in a destination of 2 weeks duration.\r\n\r\nThe project also includes mobility of 20 teachers who have shown their interest in observing practices in an EU country. Staff mobility will last 5 days for teachers traveling to Ireland, Italy, Germany and Malta, and 10 days for teachers going to Finland. The practices will consist of visiting training centres similar to the integrated centres of vocational training in Galicia, in order to learn new didactic methods used in the country of destination.\r\n\r\nThe 33 entities that are part of the Consortium are:\r\n\r\n- IES Pedro Floriani\r\n- CEIFP A Xunqueira\r\n- Center of Agroforestal Education and Experimentation of Louriz\u00e1n\r\n- Divino Maestro Training Center in Vigo\r\n- Association EFA A Cancela\r\n- IES A Gu\u00eda\r\n- IES Frei Mart\u00edn Sarmiento\r\n- IES Chan Do Monte\r\n- IES Chapela\r\n- IES Laxeiro\r\n- IES Marco de Camball\u00f3n\r\n- IES Pintor Colmeiro\r\n- IES Ram\u00f3n Cabanillas\r\n- IES Ram\u00f3n M\u00aa Aller Ulloa\r\n- IES Ricardo Mella\r\n- IES Salvaterra de Mi\u00f1o\r\n- IES Tomi\u00f1o\r\n- IES Vilalonga (Sanxenxo)\r\n- Galician Institute of Education in Aquaculture (IGAFA)\r\n- IES Luis Seoane\r\n- IES Montecelo\r\n- CPR San Miguel\r\n- IES Polit\u00e9cnico de Vigo\r\n- IES A Xunqueira I\r\n- IES Pluriling\u00fce Terra de Turonio\r\n- Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Mar\u00edtimo Pesqueiro do Atl\u00e1ntico in Vigo\r\n- Colegio Vigo\r\n- IES Johan Carballeira\r\n- IES Rodeira\r\n- CPR DANIEL CASTELAO\r\n- CIFR A Granxa\r\n- IES Ribeira de Louro\r\n- CAPD Atl\u00e1ntico\r\n\r\nThe countries of destination and distribution of scholarships will be organized as follows: United Kingdom (23), Ireland (18), Italy (18), Malta (8), Portugal (8), Finland (4) and Netherlands (13).
