These models have a huge potentiality for dissemination, for their nature, based on information technologies. This area is multidisciplinary, because it deals with environmental science, health, chemistry and information technology. The general impact of information technology is proceeding in an exponential way. Specific use is often limited by a poor knowledge about the availability of suitable tools, cultural scepticism, and lack of training. We will address the strategies for a broad, systematic dissemination and exploitation of the research results of a number of EU projects. Specific dissemination and exploitation measures will be identified for the different stakeholders, including regulators, industry, citizens, international bodies, scientific and other associations. Dissemination towards regulators of all EU member and associated states will be provided. We will also address industry, with special attention to SME, which may gain from the software we are dealing with. We will communicate to citizens, their associations, scientists and other publics with different tools. In the consortium we have representatives of all major stakeholders involved, and a number of partners expert in efficient communication strategies. A sustainable strategy will result from the project. The software products from the different projects will be organised in a web-based system open to the public for continuous access and promotion. Links with other initiatives will exploit results at the regulatory level and in the information technology community, making results living and evolving. The mathematic approach we will disseminate will be also useful to generate simple indicators of regulation impact. ORCHESTRA will promote a repository of software and databases, suitable for updated information on European research on chemicals.", 196676.0, 900648.0, "ORCHESTRA", "Spreading the word about in silico toxicology", "With animal testing established as the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for EU regulatory toxicology, can the alternatives be understood, trusted and used by industry and regulators?  A timely EU project set out to show the value of the latest computer-based QSAR models and put them centre stage.", "The EU REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) regulation requires industry to evaluate the toxicity of new chemicals, and of tens of thousands of existing chemical substances that are in use but have never been subject to regulatory testing.  Many argue that to achieve this by traditional testing would take decades, cost billions and consume many millions of vertebrates.  REACH therefore encourages innovation, requires the use of existing data where possible, and states that further animal testing can be used only \u2018as a last resort\u2019.\n\nScientists in Milan therefore initiated the EU-funded http://www.orchestra-qsar.eu/ (ORCHESTRA) (Organising dissemination on results of projects on chemical evaluation, spreading techniques for risk assessment) project. With other partners, they set out to develop a wider understanding of the latest computer-based (in silico) \u2018QSAR\u2019 methods for evaluating toxicity, and to share insights across sectors.\n\nStructure-activity relationship (SAR) models correlate structural features of a molecule with its toxicity effects (end points).  While classical SAR models use evidence of toxicity and current understanding of the mechanisms of toxic action, Quantitative SAR (QSAR) models radically change this by utilising the power of computers to investigate and model SAR relationships mathematically.  QSAR models can use all the available experimental data on toxicity for a range of related chemicals, to identify structural properties of the molecules that correlate statistically with particular toxicity end points.  They can make use of potentially hundreds of existing experimental results to ensure reliability, to identify new toxicity correlations beyond those currently understood, and to evaluate potentially thousands of chemicals in a day.  As the EU\u2019s European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) advocate, when existing data is sufficient, QSAR models can complement and reduce, as well as replace, further costly animal testing.\n\nORCHESTRA created a four-part video documentary titled 'QSAR in REACH: Uses, issues and priorities' from interviews with regulators, industry representatives and QSAR experts. Training materials for a 15-session course were developed for graduate and postdoctoral students and made available on the ORCHESTRA website.\n\nThe project organised an international workshop to spur interaction among industry, regulators and software developers regarding the regulatory use of QSAR methods.  ORCHESTRA representatives also participated in several international toxicology conferences, and put a video installation, computer terminals and expert support in a booth at the centre of the SETAC 2011 Europe conference.\n\nThe project produced an e-book, 'Theory, guidance and applications in QSAR and REACH', as well as brochures, newsletters, videos, reports, articles and online information, to generate understanding and inspire change across sectors.  These are available on the website and elsewhere.\n\nORCHESTRA is improving toxicology assessment in line with EU policy, by providing stakeholders across sectors with an accessible understanding of QSAR models as alternative methods, and of how they can be used.", null, "http://www.publicspace.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/159553.jpg", "fp7_91172_998195185"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LA12"}
