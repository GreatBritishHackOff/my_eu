The approach encompasses a variety of different types of requirements, relating to security, airport operations and societal aspects. An ethical framework will be defined which enables designers and operators to proactively introduce ethical factors in the checkpoint. The project team will identify and develop requirements and criteria at integrated system level. A key element of the project is the development of a design tool that allows the design of innovative new CPs and modification of existing CPs to meet changing threats. A major challenge comprises a validated set of protocols and tools for evaluating and monitoring the performance of the CP at the overall system rather than component level. The approach will be demonstrated in two integrated demonstration CPs at two airports. The activities are focussed towards aviation security but may be extended to mass transportation and other applications.", null, 11526471.0, "XP-DITE", "Optimising checkpoints at airports", "Airport checkpoints (ACPs) should be planned and built with a view to the required security performance of the entire checkpoint system. An EU initiative is working on an innovative approach for designing and assessing ACPs.", "Existing techniques test and assess individual components and do not provide a clear picture of the overall performance of ACPs. A method is needed that takes into consideration all operation and design elements of an ACP system when evaluating its capacity to deliver efficient and effective security.\n\nThanks to EU funding, the 'Accelerated checkpoint design integration test and evaluation' (http://www.xp-dite.eu/ (XP-DITE))\u00a0project is developing a holistic approach enabling airport operators and other key stakeholders to design and assess ACPs. This innovative technique allows performance assessment to be measured against cost, throughput, customer service, security level, regulatory compliance and ethical requirements. In addition, an enhanced ACP system design should be able to adapt and respond to emerging and ever-changing dangers.\n\nTo achieve this, project members are creating design and evaluation tools and methods that will be tested at two European airports. During the first 18 months of the project, the team gathered overall system requirements and evaluation criteria for the development of an ACP conceptual model.\n\nThe model is being used to create the design and evaluation tools. Project partners developed a method and a tool for the design of two ACPs based on system-level requirements. They also defined requirements for the evaluation tool.\n\nThe team developed a framework for the evaluation of ethical and societal aspects in ACP screening. In addition, it drafted guidelines for ACP design to help meet ethical and societal needs and avoid costly redesigns.\n\nSeveral novel detection system components for future ACPs are nearing completion, including an X-ray and trace explosives detection system, a security scanner, and biometric identification and tracking technologies.\n\nXP-DITE will deliver optimised security performance and provide airports with the option to use innovative procedures and technology. The overall passenger experience will be made safer and more satisfying as a result.
