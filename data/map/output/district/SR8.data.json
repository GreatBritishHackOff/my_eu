The duration of the project is 1 year. The duration of activity is 1 month.The applicant as well as sending organisation is Tallinna Kesklinna Vene G\u00fcmnaasium (Tallinn Central Russian Gymnasium) which is located in Tallinn, Estonia. TKVG is one of the oldest schools in Estonia, which was established in 1923. The school offers 12 grades of secondary education for 1200 students under the guidance of more than 100-member  teaching staff. TKVG is a community of students from different ethnic backgrounds.The receiving organisation is the Academy at Shotton Hall which is located in Peterlee, Tees Valley and Durham, the UK.  The Academy at Shotton Hall converted to become an academy school on 1st February 2011. When its predecessor school, Shotton Hall School, was last inspected by Ofsted, it was judged to be outstanding. It is a designated teaching school. This academy is larger than the average-sized secondary school. A well-below-average proportion of students are from minority ethnic backgrounds, and a similar proportion speaks English as an additional language. The proportion of disabled students and those with special educational needs who are supported through school action is average, whilst the proportion supported at school action plus and with a statement of special educational needs is above average.The aims of the project are to enhance professional skills and competences of the teaching staff of TKVG, to adopt new language teaching methods and innovative approaches to learning, to improve abilities to respond to individual learners' needs and to deal with their social, cultural and linguistic diversity, to familiarise with and adopt the culture and the living environment of the UK through real experience, to improve English and develop skills in training refugee children, inter-cultural classrooms, teaching pupils in their second language, classroom tolerance and diversity.The target group of the project is foreign language teachers of TKVG. The group consists of 20 members. The sending organisation will send one teacher. The placement teacher will be the head of the department of foreign languages, Julia Gri\u0161t\u0161enko, who has been teaching English in TKVG since September 2013. She has a 2,5-year experience in teaching primary, secondary and upper-secondary students. She has participated in KA2  and KA3 exchange programs both in the role of a student (when she was a member of a youth organisation) and in the role of a teacher (Comenius, Nordplus). While working at TKVG as a teacher of English, she was elected as the pedagogical council of pedagogical meetings of the educational institution and in September 2015 she was elected the head of the department of foreign languages of TKVG.The staff mobility comprises a job shadowing/observation period abroad in the partner school. Initially, the tasks will consist of preparation and managing mobility. The tasks of placement teacher during her mobility will consist of observing lessons, assisting English teachers in giving lessons, substituting English teachers, managing international projects (booking flights and hotels, collecting parental consent forms from students and submitting Educational visit forms) and participation in international mobilities and helping schedule Erasmus work (participation in international mobilities will be realised by the receiving organisation). The tasks after the mobility will comprise organisation of open classes, teacher training activities and meetings, development of school curriculum and adopting new experience in classroom activities.The experience of the placement teacher will be shared with her colleagues via open lessons, teacher trainings and meetings. The English language teaching in TKVG will be advanced via implementing upgraded teaching methods and innovative approaches to learning as well as fostering tolerance in a multicultural society.Foreign language teachers of TKVG under supervision of the placement teacher and with the support of colleagues from the partner organisation will contribute to development and modernisation of school curriculum.Students of TKVG will become more interested in the English language learning, will get to know about living environment in the UK, will experience learning in new environment, and as a result, will demonstrate better results.The project activities will contribute to the partner organisation via sharing the teaching experience of TKVG,  representing a foreign culture and fostering tolerance in a multicultural society. In addition, this project will maintain and develop successful and productive partnership between the organisations.Within the framework of present and future international projects in which TKVG takes and will take part, our experience will be shared with our partner organisations further.", "http://www.shottonhallschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-EE01-KA101-017189_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SR8"}
