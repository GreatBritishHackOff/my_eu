Policies for sustainable water management have been established in the EU. However measures to support efficient water use for citizens are currently lacking. Consumers have limited means to accurately monitor their water consumption and thus stimuli to modify their behaviour towards a sustainable lifestyle.A potentially groundbreaking approach for efficient water use and reuse lies within the empowerment of consumers. The principles of open knowledge and participation have provided solutions and driven innovation in similar challenging and complex issues. We believe that a similar bottom up method, in which citizens can voluntarily adopt low cost water monitoring services, self-induce behavioural changes, and accordingly demand better services, can be a catalyst for large-scale changes in efficient water management.The DAIAD  project constitutes an innovative approach for addressing the challenge of efficient water management through real-time knowledge of residential water consumption, bringing together leading members of the water and ICT domains. Our goal is to research and develop innovative low cost, inclusive technologies for real-time, high granularity water monitoring and knowledge extraction. We will devise multi-modal feedback interfaces, recommendation, and analysis services to communicate knowledge and incur behavioural changes to consumers in residential settings. We will apply big data management and analysis technologies to provide efficient management and analysis of real-time water consumption data, as well as multiple relevant data sources.

The long-term vision of COOPOL is to develop new methods and tools for modeling and control, based on real-time sensing, which will facilitate the development of a new paradigm of processes: intensive, low-impact, sustainable chemical technologies. The COOPOL consortium is focusing on one of the key areas of interest to European Chemical Industries, namely the polymer industry. Within the chemicals sector polymer production plays a significant role, with European market share of 25% and providing employment to 1.6 million people within EU27.\nMany polymer products are manufactured using batch and semi-batch reactors. In most cases the process parameters, such as temperature profile, feeds, etc follow a specific time schedule, which has been fixed after an expensive period of product and process development. This tight recipe schedule is sensitive against disturbances e.g., unexpected variation in operating conditions, variation in feed purity etc., which inevitably leads to variations in polymer structure and\u00a0to inter-batch variability and off-spec products. Furthermore, the use of empirically determined recipes with fixed-time controls does not allow intensification of the process which requires time-varying feeds and reactor temperature to run the reaction faster and hence closer to its limits,  and also to switching from a semi-batch to other reactor or process types.\nCOOPOL addresses the complex issues of real-time process control based on advanced models and on-line sensors, to develop a generic basis for widely applicable sustainable intensified processes. COOPOL will develop a new process control approach, linking molecular level information and understanding of the reaction chemistry with real-time sensing, rigorous modeling based on first principles, subsequent model reduction and non-linear model-predictive control (NMPC) with economic objectives, called dynamic real-time optimisation (DRTO).

Space Policy is clearly on the top of such an agenda because it involves a multi-layer constituency. Space Policy presents a unique political value. It is also clear that some of the new priorities within the European Space Policy, such as the contribution of Space to the climate change or the exploration of space will take place in a global endeavour and will imply the need for Europe to develop a long-term planning in the context of an enhanced dialog with international partners. The development and implementation of a European Space Policy can be strengthened through a multi level policy study. The objectives of this study will be to define a comprehensive approach towards milestones for Space in Europe. A double framework will be adopted: _analysis of the drivers for change about space in Europe (multi level policies studies), meaning a deepening of scenarios for space key sectors. _building up a comprehensive Space policy vision. Based on a comprehensive analysis of ongoing space trends in Europe (Drivers) the study will propose a high level set of concepts to be developed within ongoing European integration, and able to foster a growing identity for space in Europe. The proposed study will follow a 3-step logic leading to findings and recommendations for possible milestones for the European in the next years : - Assessment of current orientations and possible horizons for European Space policy - Assessment of resources and opportunities to be used for implementing the European Space Policy - Concluding part: Ways forward for the European Space policy", 75472.0, 686139.0, "C-SPACE", "Action plan for future European space policy", "Scientists conducted an in-depth analysis of European Space Policy (ESP) in order to develop concepts key to future efficiency and sustainability.", "The importance of space research is often underestimated in the face of a lack of knowledge  provided to the public and to policymakers. Inadequate information enhances the susceptibility of space programmes to budget cuts, particularly in the face of the current global financial crisis.\n\nAs a major space power, the EU is committed to international cooperation in order to exploit the full potential of space exploration on multiple levels. Building on existing EC\u2013European Space Agency (ESA) cooperation is an important part of that and in the context of which scientists initiated the EU-funded 'Conditions for space policy and related action plan consolidation in Europe' (C-SPACE) project. Its goal was to identify drivers for change within key space sectors and thus propose targets for further development. Promoting public awareness of project results was an equally important factor.\n\nScientists identified main themes of the ESP and its effects on other policies, as well as on services, industrial competitiveness, security/defence and exploration/science. For each, an in-depth analysis was provided highlighting strengths and weaknesses of current space policy. In addition, a cross-sectional analysis illustrated the impact of each of these dimensions on socioeconomic factors.\n\nIn the end, C-SPACE produced a reference book titled 'Understanding the European space policy' and made available on the project website (http://www.c-space-eu.org/). It is expected to be used equally by European citizens and policymakers including those making policies in fields other than space.
