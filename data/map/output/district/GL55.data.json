They were the inactivation of PPO to prevent browning, the use of plant extracts possessing high anti-oxidative and antimicrobial abilities, and the development of processing and packaging under an oxygen-reduced atmosphere.\n\nScientists studying the reduced oxygen contact approach investigated different combinations of cover gases, packaging materials and modified atmosphere processing on apples and potatoes that were cut up under oxygen-free conditions and packed in different materials.

The crystal structure of mushroom-derived PPO was also revealed and PPO from potatoes was isolated and purified.\n\nAs SO2 possesses reducing capacities, more than 50 plant extracts were screened for their reducing as well as antimicrobial activity. Plant extracts consist of a large number of different compounds, the most effective of which were tested using in vitro assays and in vivo trials on selected model foods and in red wine.
