European aquaculture production has increased substantially over the last decades. However, overall production growth in Europe over the period 1994-2001 was 6.3% APR, 5.5% less than the global trend. The overall price trend was negative (-0.5% APR) vs positive global development. This sector has experienced increasing competition from non-EU countries, especially Asia and South America has made it imperative to increase research and development. Land based fish farming is the critical success factor in intensive aquaculture since they are the start of a very complicated value chain. Further developments of land based fish farms are therefore crucial for the aquacultural sector. Water is one of the most critical input factors, and control of water temperature is the most important factor for optimal growth. The proposed project aims to develop technology that will allow the water in an aquaculture tank to be maintained at the optimum temperature to enhance fish growth by creating a modular constructed, thermally insulated, temperature controlled, low running cost system. The OptiTEMPtank system will be constructed from rotationally moulded segments with internal foaming to provide thermal insulation, which will be joined together with an innovative system to provide a seal against the water. A temperature control system will adjust incoming water temperature to maintain the optimum required to promote maximum growth through the use of innovative water heater and cooler fuelled by biogas. The biogas will be generated from the Biomass (aquaculture faeces and unused food waste) filtered out from the outlet of the tank through the use of an innovative micro-scale anaerobic digestion biogas generator.", 89568.0, 1151506.0, "OPTITEMPTANK", null, null, null, "http://www.ist-world.org/ProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectId=f3c287ef370241a9befb06b2d8103617", "http://www.haywood-rotomoulding.co.uk", null, "fp7_94827_992886084"], ["2AU", "Advanced mechatronics devices for a novel turboprop Electric starter-generator and health monitoring system", "Nema Limited", "The ACHIEVE Consortium will bring together their world-leading expertise in the design and manufacturing of electrical machines for aircraft Advanced Generation Systems (AGS), integrated Power Electronics (PE), advanced control systems and intelligent thermal management, to develop an innovative advanced mechatronic device for electrical power management system of Turboprop.  \nThe ACHIEVE Consortium will combine their world-leading expertise in the technical areas of PE, AGS and their control, as well as in modelling and simulation for aerospace applications.

This project will include 40 youths, 10 youth leaders and 2 accompanying persons coming from five different countries, UK, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Estona and Turkey. These youths will participate in youth exchange as the activities are a build-up and complementary to each other.\r\n\r\nWith the present challenges in Europe with the immigration crisis, intolerance and racial discrimination in Europe has drastically increased. The exchange aims to identify the common causes of intolerance and analyse persisting cases of non-tolerance on the basis of culture, religion, gender, sexual orientation and race against various minorities, formulate good practices in order to reduce it, as well as strategies, which could help increase tolerance toward minorities in the participant countries and beyond. \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of this project are: \r\n- To increase awareness among young people from a minority background (cultural, ethnic, etc.) on European citizenship;\r\n- To empower youth to take an active role in local communities;\r\n- To bring together young people from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds;\r\n- To create space for dialogue;\r\n- To foster their feeling of sharing common values;\r\n- To raise their sense of belonging to Europe. \r\n\r\nTolerance nowadays has become a major factor in life and we want to equip ourselves and fellow youths with the knowledge and skills to use to as to live in harmony and raise awareness on various topics related to human rights, democracy, social inclusion, faiths, and culture.  The methodology to be used during the project includes workshops, debates, hands on activities, case studies, simulations, visits to NGOs and outreach projects. \r\n\r\nThe mobilitity will include various activities, mainly:\r\n- Group exercises, games, quizzes, simulation activities and interactive workshops on different types of discrimination; \r\n- Country presentations on discrimination cases persisting in Europe;\r\n- Various art-related activities (poster, photo-wall making, theatrical plays, etc.);\r\n- Team sports and outdoor activities;\r\n- Special video afternoons; and\r\n- Civic journalism.\r\n\r\nWe envisage that the initiative will equip all participating youths with self awareness, tools to promote culture and equality amongst males and females, to become active citizens and promote social justice and social right to vulnerable groups.  Participants will be empowered to deal with issues related to all forms of discrimination, stereotyping, ethnocentrism and prejudice -  all issues of concern in many EU communities. The activities to be held during the youth exchange are not competitive but fun packed learning experiences that will motivate us and other youths to take part in such activities and learn further more. \r\n\r\nIn the long term, we envisage to increase the networking between all participating organisations and preparing youths that will indulge tolerance in their small groups and work places.
