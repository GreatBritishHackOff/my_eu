Incineration, gasification and pyrolysis are the three main ELT management routes, with former two being responsible for environmental pollution and negative effect on the circular economy through loss of valuable materials. Pyrolysis has potential to reclaim valuable materials and prevent harmful emissions but is still commercially unattractive. \nOver the last 15 years, significant R&D efforts have been made to increase the yield and quality of pyrolysis outputs to enable its commercial uptake. One of the most valuable pyrolysis products is carbon black (CB) which, when reclaimed, purified and reused, can inject significant economic leverage. \n\nAt PPP Group, we have created the \u2018ReTyre\u2019 process for purification and valorisation of carbon black from ELT pyrolysis. ReTyre provides a sustainable and financially attractive ELT management solution and prevents pollution from the production of carbon black for burning. The objective of this feasibility study is to develop our business model for successful commercialisation of ReTyre. \n\nWith annual generation of 3.3m tons of ELTs within the EU only and the ability of recovered CB to displace virgin CB in the tyre manufacturing, paints, inks, coatings and rubber manufacture; our projections deliver a 5-year ROI of 8:1 for PPP following market entry in 2019, based on our estimated development costs of \u20ac2.12m over the next 2.5 years.", 44058.0, 62940.0, "ReTyre", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_210693_916721975"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8AN", "PETER AND MARY O'KANE", 43613.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_57620", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT44"}
