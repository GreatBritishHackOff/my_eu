Therefore, a lot of resources are used for investigating contaminated sites, limiting the damage from pollution and cleaning polluted soil and groundwater. The site investigations are very costly and time consuming. They are normally based on traditional methods where vertical drillings through the soil matrix are used for soil and groundwater sampling and testing for pollution and characterising the geology. A recent development is the use of probes driven down into the soil. The probes can be used for taking out samples of soil, water or air, or direct physical /geotechnical investigation. The sampling method is faster than drilling and can be combined with analytical equipment on the surface, hereby doing online measurements for volatile compounds. The overall aim of the MICCS project is to develop a more advanced in-situ investigation method for identifying and characterising pollution. This will be achieved by integrating more sophisticated sensors (e.g. micro-chips, electrochemical sensors, spectrometry, and optical sensors) into a solid probe intended to drive down through the soil matrix to perform continuous or semi-continuous measurements. The sensor measurements are combined with improved soil radar solutions (GPR) for better positioning and soil structure specification. The combined data are processed in a chemometric system, being able to draw a more precise picture of the contaminated site as a whole. Together, the sensor measurements provide improved and more precise data input through the chemometric analysis as basis for better decision making. Furthermore, the investigation method will be easier and quicker to use, and hence also less costly than current SOA investigation methods.", 147211.0, 1570556.0, "MICCS", null, null, null, "http://www.miccs.eu", "http://www.ehsdata.com", null, "fp7_94047_998885728"], ["3BU", "Integrity Testing of Deep Foundation Piles", "Per Aarsleff (Uk) Ltd", "A hundred thousand kilometres of piles are installed yearly in Europe. Problems can occur during pile driving including spalling of concrete at the pile\u2019s head or point and transverse or spiral cracking. Industry figures suggest that as many as 3-5% of piles fail during installation. If a failure is detected, the cost of that pile is increased 4 times due to the remedial work needed to replace it. If a failure is not detected during installation of the new pile, the results can be more catastrophic with costs sometimes exceeding \u20ac1 M for a single failure.\n\nCurrent pile inspection techniques involve dynamic load or sonic integrity testing. These are relatively fast to perform. However, the quality of results depends strongly on the knowledge and skill of the operator. It has been found that small defects that are less than about 0.4m (quarter wavelength) are difficult to detect. Some studies also indicate that defects representing less than 50% of cross sectional area are not detectable via sonic integrity testing.\n\nPileInspect aims to develop \u2018best practice\u2019 for inspecting the integrity of cast-in-place and pre-cast concrete piles and of steel piles.

It provides one advantage over other plastic processing technologies: production of seamless articles, with uniform wall thickness and complex shapes for sectors as chemical storage, toys, construction and transports. However this technology has stuck without major innovative improvements in last years becoming energy inefficient and costly, and at the same time other techniques which have substantially improved (as injection moulding or blowing moulding) are not suitable for such large pieces. Moreover, it has to face up to the growing market of low cost plastic goods from China and India. As a result, rotational moulding industry with high labour and energy costs becomes one of the most vulnerable sectors of Plastic Processing Industry. Therefore, this sector needs to research and develop technology innovations in order to provide plastic industry of high value added products which manufacturing will allow it to reduce energy consumption and production costs. The challenge is the development of low energy systems in order to enhance the energy efficiency and reduce the cycle time, without becoming more expensive. The solution proposed is an automatic rotational molding machine with the following systems: -Induction Heating System. This system will use a medium frequency power supply and helical induction coils to generate heat within the mold. It will integrate a thermal insulating layer between the coil and the mold to avoid heat losses. -Internal Cooling System. The new technology will be integrated an internal cooling system which it will consist of ionic liquids. This system will remove heat from internal mould atmosphere, reducing the cooling time. In addition, it will provide low pressure to the polymer when it has reached melt point in order to improve the mechanical properties of the final product and to reduce cycle times.", 12810.0, 2264090.0, "ROTOFAST", "Breaking the mould in plastic design", "Compared with other moulding techniques, rotational moulding is regarded as a slow process since no external pressure is applied to mould the products. EU-funded scientists are developing a cutting-edge rotomoulding machine that is energy efficient and produces plastic parts at a considerably faster rate.", "Rotational moulding is a manufacturing method for producing custom plastic products, especially hollow plastic designs. Although this process allows large and even-walled durable plastic pieces to be formed at virtually no pressure, it is energy intensive and requires a long manufacturing time.\n\nThis technology faces intense competition from a growing market of goods from low-cost\u2013labour countries. To enhance European competitiveness in the rotational moulding sector, scientists in the http://www.rotofast.eu/ (ROTOFAST) project are focused on reducing cycle time, energy consumption and product cost. For this reason, they are developing a novel rotomoulding machine with advanced heating and cooling technology.\n\nTo get homogeneous heat over the mould surface, the project team developed a mould made of multiple layers from different thermal insulation materials. This allowed decrease in heat losses by approximately 80\u00a0% compared to conventional radiant ovens.\n\nThe automatic rotomoulding machine incorporates an induction heating system that optimises energy generation, resulting in 70\u00a0% less energy consumption for each manufactured unit. Furthermore, the system heats the mould tool cavity, getting a homogeneous polymer in 30\u00a0% less time.\n\nThe prototype unit also includes an internal cooling system that is based on ionic liquids. This reduces cooling cycling time by 20\u00a0% compared to conventional cooling processes. By cooling external surfaces and the internal cavity through a closed loop design, it avoids any liquid losses.\n\nFinally, a rapid prototype protocol was developed to improve the quality of design. Using a computer-aided design file, it simulates electromagnetic fields in the system, induced heating, temperature distribution in the mould, and heat exchange between the mould and the polymer.\n\nROTOFAST is helping the future development of faster and more efficient moulding machines for plastics.

Around 10 million banana plants are grown annually in Gran Canaria. The fibre obtained from the superposed layers of the pseudo-stem is called badana. In the past, the banana plant waste was used as a support element for tomato plants, and, for some decades, it was used in handicrafts such as basket-making and artificial flowers. The plant waste was used as fodder for cattle and goats, but factory farming has replaced it by pre-digested fodder. Today, however, these vegetable wastes are deposited in ravines where they become decomposition material. An estimated 25,000 tonnes per annum of natural fibre is found in this waste.\n\nThe BADANA project will develop a process to extract high-quality natural fibre from this waste and to exploit the fibres\u2019 properties in polymer composites to be used in rotational- and injection-moulded products. This will be for the benefit of SMEs involved in the production of bananas and SMEs that supply OEMs and end-users with sustainable moulded composite products in the automotive, packaging, and consumer goods industries. This will provide the SMEs new market opportunities through satisfying the rapidly-growing demand of product manufacturers for ecoaesthetic (green) materials.  The fibre production will be integrated in a food production cycle where a fish culture in dams provides water to banana cultivation.  The fish will be fed with flour made from banana wastes.

In the past, the plant waste was a valuable side-stream. It was used to support tomato plants, to make handicrafts such as baskets and as fodder for cattle and goats. However, factory farming changed the landscape and, once the fruit is harvested, the tree's leftover organic material is simply dumped in ravines.\n\nTo address this, the http://www.badana.eu (BADANA) project reversed the tables. EU funding was provided to 12 partners representing the entire supply chain consisting of research and technology developers, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and end users. The focus was on the badana, the fibre found in the pseudo-stem layers of the banana tree.\n\nThe challenge was to find a way to separate the badana from the other parts of the tree to extract high-quality fibres suitable for polymer processing such as injection and rotational moulding. To this end, an automated reverse movement decorticating machine was designed and optimised for both the quality and quantity of the extracted fibre.\n\nSubsequently, the fibres were combined with common industrial polymers to produce eco-composites. Scientists then used the new composites to manufacture three products defined by the end users: supports for automobile windows (B-pillars), a kayak and the worktop of a washing machine.\n\nTesting demonstrated the excellent suitability for injection moulding of polypropylene compounded with banana fibres to produce green composites. Given the virtually ubiquitous use of injection moulding to form plastic composites, BADANA technology presents an important opportunity for partner SMEs. The eco-friendly materials will be attractive alternatives to many existing products and are expected to open up new markets as well.\n\nA comprehensive analysis quantified the multiple environmental benefits that arise from the new process.

The activities of each partner organisation, regardless of their differing foci, enable each volunteer to connect issues of racism, discrimination and prejudice through providing support for people with fewer opportunities. Each organisation also has historical links, or is influenced by European history, helping volunteers to appreciate the effects of racism, discrimination and what can happen if people are excluded from society, a theme that very much remains relevant in contemporary Europe. \r\nVolunteers at the Aegis Trust, Jewish Museum and Wiener Library contribute to pedagogical programmes, often with local, European and international school classes, contributing their own historical perspectives and views on contemporary Europe. The diverse range of groups involved with these three hosting organisations brings the volunteers into contact with young people from different social and cultural backgrounds, enabling them to demonstrate that a voluntary service is a very productive activity, regardless of where one comes from. The volunteers at the Jewish Museum and Wiener Library will also regularly work with and support Holocaust survivors, furthering their understanding of the effects of social exclusion and hopefully strengthening their commitment to civil society, tolerance and inclusion.\r\nThe themes of the voluntary services at the Southwark Day Centre for Asylum Seekers and Roma Support Group are very similar with the volunteers supporting refugees, asylum seekers and Roma on a daily basis, all people who have to endure very difficult circumstances, generally as a result of discrimination and racism, leading to exclusion from mainstream society. The volunteers can provide these people with invaluable support, helping them to integrate into life in the UK as smoothly as possible through providing language courses, preparing cultural activities or simply offering a hot meal everyday, amongst many other activities.\r\nThree German volunteers will be involved in this project, all will be based in London, at either the Aegis Trust, Jewish Museum or Wiener Library.\r\nThree Polish volunteer will also be in involved in this project, all based in London, with two at the Roma Support Group and one at the Southwark Day Centre for Asylum Seekers.

The aim of this project is to meet the  increasing demand of trainees with work experience abroad. Not only can the students learn the theoretical aspects of their training but also can they experience the real working life abroad. Furthermore both the language and the intercultural skills which require openness and empathy towards different living and working conditions abroad are of special importance.\r\n\r\nBy doing an internship in the EU our trainees will have a competitive advantage in German companies  and thus concerning their professional competency. As a lot of them are forced to leave our structually weak region after their traineeship this is of particular relevance. Just as all of our projects since the year 2000 this project is aiming both at sustainability and at encouraging the willingness to mobility. Since the 2008 flow local companies have tended to be interested in arranging their trainees\u2019 internship within their company structure and they have taken on less interns from other companies. This is why the twin towns Scarborough and Ostroda and the twin schools of the Leonardo da Vinci Mobility Project play an important part in putting the trainees in contact with companies abroad.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities take place in the Easter, summer and autumn holidays. First the applicants have to hand in a motivational letter and a Europass CV. After intense interviews we implement an intercultural training block course individually matched to the participants in order to prepare the mobility. Before the departure there is a meeting where the learning contract and the Europass mobility are set up. While being abroad the trainees are required to send short status reports to the project managers via email. The quality management is effected by means of reflection and evaluation sheets. Additionally the realised internships are assessed by a presentation at school in the vocational classes and a report published on our homepage. Non-satisfactory aspects of the internship are examined and improved in the next travel period.\r\n\r\nMoreover we enable our trainees to adapt their professional and social skills so as to attune them to Europe as a potential workplace. Concerning their academic performance the participants are predominantly good or very good students. We therefore expect them, above all, to act independently regarding the acquisition of the internship as well as the organization of accommodation, departure and arrival.
