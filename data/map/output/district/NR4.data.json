In photosynthetic and sessile organisms like plants, maintenance of sugar homeostasis requires complex regulatory mechanisms. In recent years, a pivotal role for sugar as signalling molecules has become apparent and many efforts have been done to study the molecular mechanisms of sugar regulation. Recently, isolation and characterisation of the high sugar response mutant 8 (hsr8) revealed a link between sugar sensing and cell wall integrity pathways. The hsr8 mutant was isolated because it displayed, in response to sugar levels, increased dark development, increased sugar-regulated gene expression, increased starch and anthocyanin levels and reduced chlorophyll content (Li et al, 2007). The hsr8 mutation was mapped in the gene encoding the first enzyme of the arabinose biosynthetic pathway. This suggests that the defect in the cell wall composition is sensed, transduced to the nucleus, and lead to altered glucose-responsive growth and development. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the Pleiotropic Regulatory Locus 1 (PRL1) was one component of this cell wall integrity pathway. The aim of this proposal is to use a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to identify components of the cell wall integrity pathway and to establish the relationships with sugar-responsive and growth control pathways.

Understanding the molecular basis of temperature perception is of interest from both a fundamental scientific perspective as well as having implications for understanding how plants (which comprise more than 1.25 trillion tonnes of biomass) will respond to climate change. The distribution and flowering time of wild plants has already been measurably altered by climate change, and this will become more dramatic under projected changes. Knowing the mechanisms of temperature perception will facilitate crop-breeding programs as well as provide important knowledge for predicting future effects of climate change. To this end, we propose a multi-disciplinary program exploiting two powerful model systems, Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon, to address 5 key questions: 1. What is the molecular basis for temperature perception? 2. How is the temperature transcriptome coordinately regulated? 3. How are the flowering time pathways regulated by temperature? 4.

A similar process was followed for maize so that models of overall epigenetic changes for both A.\u00a0thaliana and maize (Zea mays) could be developed.Several maize genes that were affected by epigenetic changes (epitargets) were studied further for potential stress-resistant traits. As a result of this, new stress-resistant maize strains were developed for further analysis.\n\nDuring the course of the research, various tools and protocols that are widely applicable to environmental epigenetics research were developed as well. These included a number of methods for stressing model plants, and a software package that was used to identify all the epitargets affected by specific environmental stresses.\n\nAENEAS has furthermore initiated an Environmental Epigenetics Platform for maize, which will see epigenetic information from model plants such as A.\u00a0thaliana being applied to maize.

The consortium set out to categorise foods into four groups based on their structure: cellulose-based (fruit and vegetables); protein-based (meat); combined gelled, dispersed and aerated systems (dairy products such as yogurts, creams and cheeses); and solid foam (cereal products such as bread).\n\nBy using well characterised, realistic food models, partners aim to translate the research results to mathematical models that can simulate food structure numerically as well as the effect of thermal processes on food or nutrient composition.\n\nThe 'filled cellular solid model' for fruits and vegetables has been based on different varieties of tomato, apple and brassica. Information on the effect of processing of tomato to puree or of brassica boiling on cell lysis and nutrient content has been incorporated alongside microstructure and nutrient content data. Researchers used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry and other spectroscopy methods to obtain this data.\n\nSimilarly, for the 'proteinous cellular network model', proposed models have been designed to evaluate the protein changes induced by heating and to assess which physicochemical parameters are related to protein digestibility.  Knowledge on the mechanisms involved in denaturation and oxidation of proteins during cooking has also been incorporated in this model.\n\nThe consortium has based their dairy product model on a dairy dessert and a cream cheese model. Work on these models has enabled scientists to correlate the surface composition with both temperature and composition. With respect to the 'open solid foams model', various commercial sources of fibre (bread dough, bread and biscuits) have been tested, and testing protocols for rheology, thermal, porosity, colour and status of water have been designed and validated.\n\nDREAM's experimental food models are being assessed for their ability to estimate the bioavailability of nutrients, phytochemicals and toxicants, and for microbial food safety and quality.

Aspects of the developed framework included transparency of methodologies, public engagement, relevance of results and applicability to sustainable development challenges.\n\nProject partners built on existing platforms and technologies for coupling models by replacing complex computer codes with simpler models that are faster to compute. They also successfully carried out interactive coupling of complex climate change and economic and energy system models.\n\nThe resulting coupled models were used to study the impacts of climate change on heating and cooling demand. They also enabled analysis of the impact of sea-level rise and the structural changes required in order to comply with a global warming target of 2 degrees Celsius.\n\nAn additional development was coupling a groundwater recharge module to the land surface model. This allowed carrying out an analysis of the sustainability of groundwater extraction under future climate change.\n\nA key finding was that it is economically viable to maintain terrestrial carbon stores in forest ecosystems whilst also increasing agricultural production. This is done to allow some cropland for growing biofuels while also providing for future food demand.

Already identified, these control genes have an influence over many biochemical cascades.\n\nAt the crux of the complexities is the fact that changes in expression of a few key genes affects thousands of genes downstream. Furthermore, key transcription factors can act together. For example, APETALA 1 1 (AP1) and SEPALLATA 3 (SEP3) form a complex that targets genes involved in leaf arrangement and therefore flower position. In another partnership, SEP3 forms a complex with SEEDSTICK (STK) that controls the gene VERDANDI, which has an important and direct role in fertilisation.\n\nAgain, looking at SEP1-4, AP1 and STK, the genes act in a partly overlapping, yet sometimes targeted fashion, depending on the stage of reproduction and flowering.

However, the densely compacted structure of lignocellulose is extremely resistant to being broken down by enzymes, presenting difficulties for use in bioethanol production.

Lignocellulose solids remaining after pre-treatment were hydrolysed using enzymes, and the hydrolysis residues chemically and microscopically analysed.\n\nVarious microbes are responsible for decomposing plant biomass, providing a vast source of enzymes for efficiently breaking down cellulose and hemicelluloses into fermentable sugars.

Analysis of the fungal enzyme mixture was analysed for various hemicellulase and cellulase activities led to the discovery of dozens of suitable fungal strains.

Nine representative and heterogeneous brain conditions were selected for testing: dementia, depression, epilepsy, migraine, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, stroke and substance dependency.  \n\nThe researchers analysed systematic literature reviews, patient focus groups and interviews, feedback from clinical experts and 12 databases to identify commonly experienced psychosocial difficulties. The resulting data was used to draft a data collection tool called the Paradise Protocol. This tool is user-friendly with questions that are easily understood for accurate documentation of psychosocial difficulties.\n\nTo implement the PARADISE protocol, training courses were held for the interviewers at selected centres to produce harmonised data on brain disorders. This also aided the construction of a metric for measuring psychosocial difficulties though comparisons between persons and groups of persons with different brain disorders. The resulting  Paradise-24 protocol contains psychosocial difficulty profiles, 11 determinants of psychosocial difficulty and a summary score. \n\nThe project outcomes were presented at a meeting to key stakeholders in brain disorder research and policy development and published in four peer-reviewed journals.

There is a need to better understand the effect of the complex interfacial structures that stabilise emulsions on the mechanisms involved in the breakdown of fat by lipases (Lipolysis). Lipase and its cofactor colipase have to adsorb on to the surface of fat droplets, in order to access and hydrolyse fats into their constituent components, so that they can be absorbed by the body. Processed food emulsions are stabilised by complex interfaces composed of proteins, emulsifiers and lipids. Lipase action is very sensitive to interfacial composition. We have shown that bile salts can displace the protein networks, but the extent to which interfacial structures are degraded during digestion will determine how quickly lipid is broken down and digested. By slowing down lipid digestion is thought that we can induce feelings of satiety and reduce subsequent dietary fat intake by reducing appetite.

It also looked closely at social and environmental policies, examining how they are expanding or contracting. From these elaborate studies, it developed a model for understanding policy change and demystifying the often overlooked concept of policy dismantling. A strong focus was placed on examining regulatory density (extent to which a certain policy area is covered by governmental activities) and regulatory stringency (intensity or strictness of adopted measures).\n\nAmong the project's main findings, Consensus noted three possible international drivers for policy change: namely, regulatory competition, harmonisation and policy dissemination. It also highlighted three domestic drivers for policy change, these being macroeconomic austerity pressures, problem pressure, and domestic politics and institutions. The project's key achievements also included the development of indicators to measure aspects of policy change and guidance for the national policy experts in collecting relevant research data.\n\nOverall, the project found that social policy change is more balanced than that of environmental policy, with the latter being more resistant to dismantlement.

Researchers employed physicochemical approaches to determine how different food structures such as emulsions interact with digestive enzymes, surfactants and fats in a simulated gut environment.

Bacterial infection in the root epidermis and nodule organogenesis in the root cortex occur concurrently but how this coordination is achieved is unknown. Perception of NF leads to the activation of calcium oscillations in root epidermal cells which are likely decoded by CCaMK, whose function requires two GRAS transcription factors, NSP1 and NSP2.

During a cold-induced process called vernalization, the floral repressor gene FLC is epigenetically repressed and maintained inactive by a plant PRC2 and VRN1. Lack of VRN1 does not impair PRC2 function but seems to act downstream or in parallel of PRC2, a situation analogous to animal PRC1. Moreover, as found for mammalian PRC1, VRN1 interacts with a component of the spliceosome complex, implying RNA processing in Polycomb silencing.

However, after a long cold winter, the gene is suppressed, and the plant is able to flower. Although, the gene has variations in its alleles - DNA sequences of a particular gene.

The project showed that, after a relatively short vernalisation period, there was a delay in flowering.\n\nFurther tests on Lov-1 were carried out to determine what part of FLC contributed to the late flowering period. Results showed that a variation within FLC was responsible for the delay which allowed FLC to be activated, and thereby prevent flowering.\n\nWhen delving deeper to discover why FLC had this variation, the researchers found that a specific histone (a protein that regulates genes) associated with repression plays a role: it does not successfully repress FLC to enable flowering in Lov-1.

FDP has a very similar expression pattern to FD, and will therefore be considered in parallel with FD.  The main objectives of the research project described in this proposal are: on the one hand figuring out what the components required for the FT/FD/FDP signalling module are. For this purpose I shall screen mutagenised tfl1-1 plants since in the absence of TFL1 protein, FT activity is greatly enhanced and this plants therefore provide an excellent genetic system to search for additional factors that are required for FT signalling which might not be revealed in a wild-type situation where FT is usually limiting. Furthermore, I aim to know what the cis-elements determining FD/FDP expression are by using a series of transgenic plants containing deletions in FD and FDP promoters in order to characterise the elements within FD and FDP promoters which are essential for their activity.

Results from a high-throughput mutagenesis approach suggest that the secondary structure of the Y RNA, rather than its sequence, determines where the cleavage happens that liberates the small RNAs from the 3' end of Y RNAs. This project aims validating these results and also to apply a high-throughput mutagensis screen on the 5' region of the Y RNA to study the production of small RNAs from that end of the molecule. Combining the results for Y RNA derived longer small RNA generation from both 5' and 3' end of these molecules will enable the experienced researcher to establish how this class of small RNAs are produced by designing specific novel mutants and test them in mammalian cells.

PCs bind and stabilize the folding of mutant lysosomal enzymes, allowing proper cellular translocation to the lysosome, reducing substrate accumulation.

I will determine in vitro and in vivo secondary structures for COOLAIR in two natural A. thaliana alleles with functional differences in FLC silencing and flowering time. Using both natural alleles and site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt COOLAIR secondary structure, I will assess resulting FLC silencing and flowering phenotypes to investigate the structure-function relationship. Finally, I will develop a method for identifying specific protein-binding partners and sites in COOLAIR. This research will significantly enhance our knowledge of the mechanism underlying cold-mediated silencing in FLC specifically, and of the integration of long-term environmental signals in plants in general. More broadly, it contributes to our emerging understanding of the role of lncRNAs in an epigenetic silencing mechanism that is conserved across the higher eukaryotes.

Even when comparable RNA degradation processes are involved individual RNAs can have distinct decay rates and the mechanisms that control such distinctive rates are unknown. RNA structure is likely to be intrinsic to our understanding of the RNA features that govern stability and until very recently our ability to measure the true in vivo RNA structure has been incredibly limited. \n\nThe aim of this proposal is to understand the role of RNA structure in the regulation of RNA degradation and determine the RNA structural features that regulate the degradation pathways.

Nonetheless, nature reveals solutions: the many polyploid species with diploid-like meiosis show that difficulties can be overcome.

Our work in autotetraploid Arabidopsis arenosa revealed clear WGD-associated selective sweeps on meiosis genes with roles in crossover regulation. Natural variation in at least one of these genes has a dramatic effect on meiotic chromosome pairing. Here we assess whether species that independently adapted to the challenges attending WGD evolved similar solutions, whether crossover regulation is a common target of WGD-associated adaptation and whether standing variation in diploid populations contributes to adaptation to WGD.

Plants are protected from infection by a waxy cuticular layer above the walls of epidermal cells. Would-be pathogens breaching this barrier, or entering via stomata, encounter an active plant immune system that specifically recognizes pathogens. Breaching leads to the deployment of two synergistic pathways that orchestrate immune responses. The first relies on the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and culminates in pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). When the first is circumvented a second array of responses takes place known as effector triggered immunity (ETI). In ETI, host factors known as R proteins recognize pathogen effectors, an event which is accompanied by the execution of a unique programmed cell death (PCD) type known as the hypersensitive response (HR). Although the initiator of the HR-PCD is known to depend on the formation of an effector-R complex, the downstream molecular events remain elusive. Previous results showed that particular proteases known as metacaspases (MCs) modulate HR-PCD, highlighting the importance of proteolysis and proteome rearrangements for HR-PCD modulation.

In yeast and mammals, Fe is sensed via Fe-S proteins, but in plants the Fe sensing mechanism has been shown to be independent from Fe-S cluster assembly in the mitochondria or cytosol.

Expression of miR395 will be induced by low level of sulfur to down-regulate GFP expression. After replenishing the media with sulfur, miR395 transcription is switched off and the existing miR395 molecules will be degraded, leading to green fluorescence recovery in the seedlings. The speed of this recovery is about three days in wild type plants and I will screen for lines exhibiting faster or slower recovery.

These receptors activate an array of signalling events, culminating in a massive transcriptional reprogramming, leading to PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Although this transcriptional reprogramming is vital for establishing plant defence, our knowledge of the mechanisms by which it is mediated remains fragmented.
