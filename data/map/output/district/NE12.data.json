The key innovation is a positive detection lateral-flow test for small molecules that is highly sensitive and simple to use making it ideally suited to deployment by First Responders at crime scenes and terrorist incidents. Lateral flow immunodiagnostics has long offered the promise of fast, high quality testing for substances of low molecular weight. There have however been very real challenges to bringing the full power of such technology to bear in this area. The problem is simply size. Large analytes can support the simultaneous binding of both capture and detector antibodies, allowing typical excess-reagent sandwich immunoassays to be formatted in which increasing analyte concentration provides an increase of observable signal over a very low zero background. Small molecules are simply not large enough to support such simultaneous binding. Alternative systems in effect measure how much analyte is not present. This causes major problems in terms of precision, sensitivity and read-out where, classically, increasing concentration of analyte reduces the signal produced, making point-of-need devices often difficult to read. What is required is a robust system in which there is no observable signal in the absence of analyte, and even low level samples give an obvious observable signal over this zero background. SALIANT offers a system based on a small bindable moiety that is first conjugated close to the binding site of a primary antibody against the analyte such that when analyte binds the antibody, the moiety can still be bound by a labelled secondary antibody. A large reagent-analogue of the analyte is also introduced, binding analyte-unbound primary antibody, and thereby blocking binding of the secondary antibody to the moiety. Thus the more analyte present, the more binding of secondary antibody occurs and the more signal is produced.", 93490.0, 3779421.0, "SALIANT", null, null, null, "http://www.saliant.eu/home", "http://www.celsgroup.com/home.html", null, "fp7_95761_995224075"], ["8BX", "HIgh Speed PRoteomics Analysis (Prot-HiSPRA): Solving the bottlenecks of proteomics technologies for time sensitive proteome driven medical decisions", "Centre of Excellence for Life Sciences Ltd", "The main objective of the proposed collaborative project Prot-HiSPRA is to remove time-consuming bottlenecks of existing proteomics technologies (sample preparation, fractionation, proteolysis, separation, data collection, and data mining) and bring the proteome driven analysis into time sensitive clinical practice. Prot-HiSPRA is an objective-driven research project and it aims at generating new knowledge and new technologies which will improve the European competitiveness in the field of applied proteomics. Prot-HiSPRA is planned for the duration of 36 months which is necessary in order to ensure a high-quality validation of the developed high-throughput methodologies. A strong participation of SMEs (partner 2 \u2013 MAYLAB, partner 3 \u2013 CELS - left the onsortium, partner 6 \u2013 RTDs, partner 7 - BIA) will ensure strong innovation and exploitation during HiSPRA. Research activities in the Prot-HiSPRA program can be divided into a technological core project that is tailored to significantly improve on technologies in the fields of proteomics, bioinformatics, and integrated biology. Analytical methods developed with the Prot-HiSPRA project will be exemplified by applying for analysis of clinical samples originating from in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures. During the IVF process, especially at the moment when decisions are made which embryo can be implanted, decisions must be made so that the process has the greatest chance for success. To further elevate pregnancy rates for IVF a non-invasive, rapid, and robust methods for judging the embryos status is urgently needed to examine the embryos\u00b4 proteome.

Starting from these results, in weDRAW we will develop an multisensory technology and three serious games that will exploit the best modality for learning arithmetic and geometrical concepts.\nIn particular weDRAW:\n- will provide the elements to the teacher to determine which is the best modality (visual, audio or haptic) to teach each specific concepts to the students; \n- will provide the technology to exploit the best sensory signal; \n- will permit to teach different concepts together. This will be possible by using a multisensory approach, that will open a new teaching/learning channel, personalized for each student, based on multisensory interactive technology (i.e., audio, tactile, motor and visual), including a serious game platform. \n- will show that it is possible to learn arithmetical concepts from multisensory rhythm exploration and music and geometrical concepts from body movement and multisensory drawing.\n- will permit a \u201cdeeper learning of Science and Mathematics combined with Arts\u201d improving creative capacities of learners.\nBesides application to typical children, a major goal and output of this project consists of applying the proposed multisensory approach and technologies to two specific populations: visually impaired and dyslexic children. In particular, dyslexic children have problems with rhythm, whereas visually impaired children have problems with space and geometry.
