Therefore, natural partners in using climate services to assess risk are the Global Insurance Sector, who are key implementers in increasing societies resilience and recovery of extreme events and who are integral, co-design partners in this programme. This project intends to operationalize a system, called the Oasis Loss Modelling Framework, that combines climate services with damage and loss information and provides a standardised risk assessment process that can assess potential losses, areas at most risk and quantify financial losses of modelled scenarios. We intend to prove the Oasis LMF system through undertaking a range of demonstrators linked and co-designed to \u2018real\u2019 situations and end-user communities in the insurance, municipalities and business sectors (see list of partners & collaborators). These demonstrators have already been agreed with our end-users and develop work around hydro-climatic risk (in the Danube Region), Typhoon Risk, African Farmer Risk \u2013 through using climate information to support the underwriting of micro-insurance, climate v health and climate v forest asset risk assessment. We also intend to further expand access by all sectors to the models, tools and services developed within this programme and the broader climate services sector by operationalizing an open eMarket place and matchmaking facility for catastrophe and climate data and models, tools and services and through broadening awareness in the climate modelling and end-users communities to the Framework, and the transparent and comparable standard it offers to support evidence based risk assessment and adaptation planning.", 262420.0, 4757608.0, "H2020_Insurance", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_210519_920591208"], ["4JS", "The Mobi Charger, a novel mobile Electric Vehicle charging station that requires no installation costs, offers easy scalability and utility bill savings for users.", "Freewire Technologies Limited", "FreeWire\u2019s Mobi is a novel, mobile charging station that brings the charge to the vehicle.

As a result, the power is generated very far from where it is meant to be consumed, causing an energy loss of 20% during the transfer (line-losses); they also need strong winds to function and are expensive to install and maintain.\n Newenergy21 has designed and developed UrbaVento, an innovative vertical axis wind turbine for decentralized energy-production (smart grid applications as well as off-grid), which features carbon-fibre \u201cwings\u201d, as well as a smart control and fault diagnostic software that simplifies maintenance and troubleshooting and tracks performance and savings. \nThe UrbaVento is a big leap forward compared to current wind turbines due to its unique advantages, which are firstly: its compatibility with the urban environment, since it features silent energy production at low wind speeds, starting from less than 3m/s, while it can produce up to 10 MWh of electricity per year when operating between 7 and 10m/s; it is suited for distributed power production because it can be installed anywhere due to its compact size and attractive appearance. Secondly, it offers a higher return on investment since it is cheaper to install, operate and maintain, due to its low number of moving parts, the absence of a gearbox and the location of all serviceable components are at ground level, enabling the turbine to seamlessly reach its envisaged life-cycle; Thirdly, its wings can be used as a reflective screen, making it an attractive medium for advertising.\nThe Phase 1 project will be focused on establishing a complete supply chain, a sound business model and commercialization strategy, a planning of all activities for deploying a large scale pilot with 10 turbines installed in different locations, as well as the elaboration of an industrialization and marketing plan.", 36142.0, 51631.0, "URBAVENTO", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_198845_927815768"], ["4JS", "An online software platform for effectively matching investors with start-ups, focused on boosting the cleantech sector", "Cagix Eu Limited", "CAGIX is a software company, with long-term experience in the start-ups, incubation and investment industry, which has developed an online incubation platform that covers investment preparation, incubator operations and portfolio company management. The investor ecosystem is fragmented and opaque and attracting investment is a lengthy process. Early stage start-ups often have little knowledge of business planning or fund-raising procedures and therefore deals can be perceived as risky. Currently, there is no system on which investors can search for valuable start-up industries abroad. Start-ups and innovation need to be better managed through technology to achieve results; technology has the potential to make incubation, investment preparation and capital transactions more efficient, highly scalable and less expensive. CAGIX\u2019s software platform offers start-ups a proven efficient path to build up the perfect investor package and provide the relevant information needed by investors. This facilitates the due diligence of interested investors, saving time and expenses and guaranteeing a high quality standard and uniformity for the deals. The CAGIX platform hosts an innovative proprietary deal search engine which when applied to the start-up database enables investors to meet companies raising money and carry out faster transactions through CAGIX\u2019s streamlined process. The platform is specifically focused on CLEAN-TECH and climate change hosting eighteen diverse sectors within the field including biofuels, hydropower, recycling and transportation. Within the overall project, CAGIX aims to: standardize the design of the website and information portrayed to investors; localize the platform to support foreign currencies and languages; address local financial laws/regulations for investors across Europe; establish a sound marketing and commercialization strategy and launch at least 3 pilots in 3 EU countries with the involvement of end-users, incubators and investors.", 36206.0, 51723.0, "CAGIX", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_198863_927212913"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4LR", "The Film Garage", "THE LONDON INTERNATIONAL FILM SCHOOL LIMITED", 36493.0, "The Film Garage is a training programme for European scriptwriters developing feature length genre films.Over a six month period, nine screen writers worked with the support of experienced European industry trainers to fully develop their genre scripts.
