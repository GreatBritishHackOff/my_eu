The catalogue of Kill\u25cfSpill products & technologies is based on a review of technology & knowledge gaps in approaches of oil spill disasters and brings appropriate tools for 1st response, follow-up, and longer-term actions, specifically tailored to the versatility of oil spills. Kill\u25cfSpill develops chemicals & biochemicals to be used for 1st response actions to disperse/emulsify oil and materials enabling the containment and sorption of oil, preparing the field for the follow-up actions. Kill\u25cfSpill develops (Bio)technologies aiming at intensified biodegradation processes by bioaugmentation/biostimulation as follow-up and longer term actions in aerobic/slight anoxic compartments. Kill\u25cfSpill develops (bio)technologies adapted for the remediation of anoxic/anaerobic fresh & chronically polluted sediments. Kill\u25cfSpill compiles knowledge on dispersion/sorption and biodegradation processes to produce multifunctional products, which are suited for follow-up and longer term actions. The multifunctional products address the necessity for integrated bioremediation (bioavailability, metabolic requirements, etc.) and are efficient along the whole redox gradient from surface water to sediments. The products/technologies are field-tested in open sea oil spills and large mesocosms to unravel the champions products & technologies. The (bio)tools are benchmarked with existing solutions using cutting-edge analytics, biosensors, and omics and checked for eco-efficiency to merit green label. Kill\u25cfSpill consortium is multidisciplinary and gathers 33 partners from 12 EU and EU-associated countries and USA; 18 research & academic institutions, 14 SMEs, and 1 association of oil spill companies work together with the support of a high level advisory board to cover the whole chain of oil spill (bio)remediation.", 47919.0, 9937420.0, "Kill\u25cfSpill", "Using microbes for oil spill clean-up", "Scientists are developing bio-based products to detect, monitor and detoxify marine oil spills in an eco-friendly way.", "Oil spills that release harmful petroleum hydrocarbons into the marine environment can be cleaned up in several ways. These include sponge-like sorbents that absorb oil, dispersants that chemically break down oil, and microorganisms that biologically degrade oil by consuming it as an energy source.\n\nThe latter process is known as biodegradation or bioremediation. The EU-funded 'Integrated biotechnological solutions for combating marine oil spills' (http://www.killspill.eu/ (KILL.SPILL)) project aims to find such viable solutions to oil spills using both established and novel methods.\n\nWhile dispersing or collecting/skimming the oil is the first response following an oil spill, KILL.SPILL products are intended for longer-term actions across a range of conditions. Researchers have thus far advanced novel hydrocarbon-detecting biosensors that monitor the efficiency of oil-degrading bacterial communities, and development of bioremediation agents (biosurfacants for bio-based dispersants, microbial\u2013chemical combinations for integrated bioremediation agents).\n\nThey have also isolated bacterial strains from marine, terrestrial and industrial environments to study their oil-degrading capabilities. Systems in development include bacteria adapted to the high pressures of deep-sea environment (in high pressure bioreactors), oil-degrading microorganisms with high tolerance to environmental stresses, and microbes that degrade oil in ocean floor sediments under anaerobic or aerobic conditions.\n\nKILL.SPILL's versatile range of tools will cover gaps in current approaches to cleaning up oil spill disasters, with applications for first response, follow-up and monitoring. Further work will involve assessing the toxicity and impact of the products on the environment, and validating their efficiencies in a real oil spill scenario.", null, "http://www.ukspill.org", "/docs/results/images/2015/153742.jpg", "fp7_104509_957283883"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TF13"}
