It was established to enable sports clubs, organisations and Associations, through educational initiatives to excel.\r\n\r\nThe strategic vision of IIS is to serve community, grassroots, amateur and professional sports clubs and associations by helping them to 'Educate, Enable & Excel', which is our strap-line.  Invest in Sport Limited was established to enable sports clubs, organisations and Associations, through educational initiatives to excel.\r\n\r\nIIS recognises the importance of educating VET staff within sports organisations, to enable them to excel by being more effective, efficient, professional, competitive and financially sustainable. \r\n\r\nUlster Rugby has a proud tradition of performing at the highest level having a record number of Irish Interprovincial Championship wins, defeating international touring sides, securing the Celtic Cup in 2003 and Celtic League in 2006 (forerunners to the Pro 12) in the past and being the first Irish province to secure the European (Heineken) Cup when they won it in 1999. Since then they have been more than competitive reaching finals in both competitions (Heineken Cup 2011-12, and PRO12 in 2012-13).  However they have not won any silverware since 2006. For such a proud province in a nation with the stature in rugby of Ireland these are issues which need to be addressed in NI. \r\n\r\nUlster Hockey and its predecessors has a long history of involvement with the Provincial Hockey League and Irish Hockey League (league for the island of Ireland) as well as playing in European and international tournaments and league competitions. \r\n\r\nEuropean Rugby Challenge Cup is an annual European rugby union competition organised by European Professional Club Rugby. It is the second tier competition for clubs whose country's national team compete in the Six Nations Championship, as well as some teams from select other European nations.\r\n\r\nThe Mobility work programme for IIS participants will have the following clearly defined objectives:-\r\n1. To exchange and enhance player development expertise at all levels ranging from youth to intermediate to professional senior team level, from Academy age group to the Professional team.\r\n2. To give the learners exposure to the professional rugby environment of a French professional club in the Top 14\r\n3. To improve the coaching efficiencies for NI VET staff and players and facilitate the introduction, where appropriate of best practice French coaching innovations to enhance player development stage pathways and skills\r\n4. To see theory in practice through on site learning and development to enhance VET delivery\r\n5. To assist technology transfer and exchange of culture, life experiences, both nationally and internationally and work practices contrast between NI and French VET staff\r\n6. To identify new trends in recruitment, nutrition & team preparation, and team tactical play, which should be of value to the VET staff in both enhancing personal development and skills acquisition amongst the groups\u2019 individual participants\r\n7. To compare and contrast the competitive standard of rugby on an age matched basis demonstrated by FC Grenoble and Ulster rugby in NI\r\n\r\nThe key point of contact will be Bernard Jackman, FC Grenoble's Director of Rugby. FC Grenoble's preparation prior to the arrival of the mobility participants, will involve key members of staff liaising with the IIS Steering Committee and with the French club's technical coaching staff, during the logistical and schedule preparations, prior to departure.\r\n\r\nFC Grenoble's staff will assist in the implementation of the mobility work programmes and deal with all aspects including logistical arrangements, to ensure full integration into FC Grenoble's professional rugby environment and the French coaching and training regimes.", null, "Invest in Sport Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036436_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT26"}
