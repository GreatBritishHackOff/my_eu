The need is now to protect the softer, unprotected areas such as mass transportation systems and hubs which are being targeted with devastating effect (London, Madrid). They are largely unprotected since current security systems are too expensive and too slow. Therefore, there is an urgent need for innovative new security screening technology that can provide a low cost, rapid \u2018walk-by\u2019 screening at normal flow rates. Whilst millimetre-wave (mm-wave) technology is the leading technology, cost is a barrier. The critical part of mm-wave systems is the detector module, at a cost of \u20ac1125 per pixel, the imager module accounts for 60% of the overall system cost. At present this high cost is due to the cost of semiconductor material and the cost of assembly and tuning to overcome resonance effects.\n\nThis proposal will develop an innovative solution to reduce mm-wave module cost down to \u20ac150. This is clearly ambitious, but with the innovations below we are confident we can be successful:\n\na) Integrating the LNA & detector stages onto a single semiconductor wafer\nb) Developing GaAs semiconductor wafer using mHEMPT epi-layer instead of pHEMT\nc) Integrating a novel antenna and waveguide into a low cost, injection moulded liquid crystal polymer (LCP) substrate.\n\nThis is an extremely challenging project requiring significant scientific knowledge generation and technology development.

In 2017, a total of 18 students will participate in five-month long internships in 12 countries. Fourteen new partner institutions have been identified and selected for this purpose. Fourteen students will take part in the three-week internships carried out with our long-term partners in the UK, Poland, France, the Netherlands and Finland. Foreign stays for teaching staff are foreseen in Spain, the Netherlands, Finland and France. The long-term cooperation with France and Finland will be continued, and the establishment of a network with Italy thoroughly examined.   \r\nIn 2017, profession-related content within the student preparatory course will be taught bilingually (English-German) for the first time (in addition to English lessons). For this purpose, a second teacher should be employed in a co-teacher capacity. \r\nInternational exchange activities were implemented in the form of several special events held with foreign guests in 2016. A return visit with social pedagogy coordinators from Bologna, Italy - held in order to acquaint the Italian visitors with the PFH and to explore potential partnership opportunities - took place on April 22, 2016, as a result of exchange between vocational teaching personnel.  \r\nIn December 2015, a delegation of 34 Turkish teachers - seconded by the Turkish Ministry of Education \u2013 visited upon the recommendation of the Berlin Senate.  The event proved to be such a success that a follow-up event with 12 more participants took place on June 23, 2016. Our intention to expand and deepen existing contact with educational institutions in Turkey has been somewhat shaken by ongoing political developments in the country. Subject to unfolding events in the country, a vocational teaching personnel visit - to explore further cooperation opportunities with partners in Turkey - should take place in early 2017. Appropriate discussions were held with the director of the Istanbul International School on 14.04.2016. We are in contact with other secondment institutions for the latest information. \r\nDuring the period June 17-22, 2016, employees of the Maison Sociale, one of our long-standing partners in Lyon, visited for professional discussions and \u201cwork-shadowing\u201d in practice establishments. We are currently seeking to intensify the level of mutual exchange between students.  One of our students is currently participating in a \u201csocial-space oriented\u201d internship model project. \r\nDuring the period October 10-14, 2016, a representative from a new partner, Graafschap College in the Netherlands, visited. As a vocational college, this provider operates practice establishments and provides training. The intention here is to become better acquainted with the work carried out by the partner. \r\nA special celebratory event is planned for May 4-5, 2017, in order to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Europe work at PFH. Representatives from longstanding partner institutions are expected to attend, with discussions concerning joint themes and development of broader perspectives to be held within the context of international networking.  \r\nInternally, discussions with director have succeeded in securing a higher hour calculation for the colleagues within the Europe team after receipt of the charter.  As a result, two colleagues (English and French-speaking) who were only responsible for internships in Berlin to date, will also be introduced to partner contact activities. A further colleague has been named as the responsible individual for public relations activities. The PFH home page is currently being revised in-house with the stated aim of creating increased visibility for the Europe image. Since November 2016, a vocational school colleague has been working on simplifying contact between practice and the school. This will make it easier for us to involve social pedagogic staff in exchange and discussion in a more targeted fashion. \r\nOn April 13, 2016, we successfully presented the project to the board of Trustees. The Berlin Senate representative signaled that an application for the provision of one permanent position for Internationalization Activities could be examined. \r\nThe change of management went successfully, thanks to resources allowing the previous incumbent to provide consultancy services; thereby allowing knowledge and experience to be secured and ensuring that continuous contact to the Europe team be maintained. \r\nA systematic qualitative evaluation leading to relevant results was carried out in 2016. Taking this as a basis, an additional quantitative instrument will be developed and tested. Qualitative evaluation will still be maintained in order to document as many possible aspects of the professional and personal development of participants over a period of several years", "http://www.canongateyouth.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA116-003618_9"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2QN", "VAMOS SCOTLAND LTD", 44742.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises  (02.02.01)", "fts_2016_30368", 2016], ["2AS", "NORTH ATLANTIC SALMON CONSERVATIONORGANISATION*", 243405.0, "Voluntary contributions to international organisations (11.06.62.03)", "fts_2016_36215", 2016], ["2AS", "NORTH ATLANTIC SALMON CONSERVATIONORGANISATION*", 194849.0, "Voluntary contributions to international organisations (11.06.62.03)", "fts_2016_38411", 2016], ["1TE", "NEWSDIRECT UK LTD*", 12584.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens' Dialogues and 'Partnership' actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2016_71284", 2016], ["2QN", "VAMOS SCOTLAND LTD", 111568.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises (02.02.01)", "fts_2017_19574", 2017], ["2AS", "NORTH ATLANTIC SALMON CONSERVATIONORGANISATION*", 226786.0, "Voluntary contributions to international organisations (11.06.62.03)", "fts_2017_37726", 2017], ["2BW", "THE SCOTTISH ARTS CLUB", 46.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens\u2019 Dialogues and \u2018Partnership\u2019 actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2017_61872", 2017], ["1TE", "NEWSDIRECT UK LTD*", 13520.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens\u2019 Dialogues and \u2018Partnership\u2019 actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2017_69166", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "EH1"}
