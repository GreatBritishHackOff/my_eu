The selected students from grades 10th and 11th, part of the above mentioned programs, will enter a two week long training program (14 days) at venues in their specific fields in Spain and Great Britain.  The first group of 15 students from the economics field will complete their training in Spain, while the second group of 15 students from the field of tourism and hospitality will complete their training in Great Britain.  In both cases the students will be accompanied by two monitoring teachers.  \r\nWithin these two mobilities, students from grades 10th and 11th are targeted based on their chosen field of study - technician in commercial and services activities and technician in tourism activities - considering the practical training required by each course of study.  In the field of economics, the students will be instructed to fulfill the duties of a sales assistant, bookkeeping and accounting.  In the field of tourism, the students will be instructed to fulfill the technical procedures characteristic to travel agencies: following the competition, booking tickets, putting together and selling holiday packages and developing a relationship with service providers.  \r\nThis project is designed to improve the professional development offered to students focusing on the practical side of this training.  Elaborate research points to the fact that it is needed to strengthen professional training at both high school and vocational school levels.  The proposed mobility project will specifically contribute to this endeavor.\r\nWe will develop a set of key competences and a set of specific competences for each program, but in addition to these, the students from each field will develop skills and abilities such as: entrepreneurial competencies, negotiation skills, leadership skills, assuming responsibility, creative thinking, perseverance, and managerial skills at the workplace.\r\nThe main objectives of these internships are the successful integration of the students at the workplace, the experience of transitioning from school to the workplace, and the usage of linguistic competences in order to become familiar with different cultures and customs.\r\nThe partners were carefully chosen taking into consideration their offer, their former experience and the recommendations we received.

This information will be used especially for the dissemination process which will be addressed to future students, to students in parallel classes, to parents and especially to the teachers from the school.  In the meantime, the management of the project will prepare an internal evaluation of every stage and the entire project in order to establish the degree of achievement of the objectives and the satisfaction of the participants involved. \r\nAn immediate impact is expected on the short run, which will manifest itself in the serious engagement of the students in their own professional development.  On the long run the impact will show in the behavioral changes of the students as well as the enrichment of the school curriculum.
