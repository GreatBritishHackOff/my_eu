In the aftermath of these encounters, virtually the entire fuselage of an aircraft can be contaminated with ash, necessitating a thorough cleaning of the cockpit, instrument panel, circuit breaker panels, passenger and baggage compartments. The electrical and avionics units can be so heavily contaminated that complete replacement is necessary, mainly due to the possibility that all the units could have suffered from overheating. The ash also contaminates the cargo-hold fire-warning system and can generate nuisance fire warnings which are due to the volcanic ash in the air rather than smoke from a fire.\nThe present proposal aims to provide an advanced airborne volcanic ash detection apparatus which will make use of special machine vision interrogation of volcanic ash (tephra) and novel image analysis software. The integrated retrofittable system will examine air in the aircraft\u2019s ventilation ducts.  By interrogating foreign bodies in the fresh air entering the cabin and identifying the type, size and number of particles per unit time and inferring the presence of low level ash particles in the possible presence of other solids in the air e.g. sand etc an early warning may be conveyed to the crew whence appropriate action may be taken to reduce the exposure of the aircraft, thus making possible enormous savings on maintenance costs.", 369237.0, 1001137.0, "AIDA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.greenbankgroup.com", null, "fp7_106810_984453777"], ["7GT", "Waste Heat Power Generation in Cement Plant", "Greenbank Terotech Ltd", "The strategic overall objective of the project is to develop a Waste Heat Recovery system for Power Generation in Cement plants. Waste Heat Recovery system (WHRS) will be based on ORC process, primarily attached to the cement production plant clinker cooler with definitive purpose to produce electrical energy from Low Temperature Waste Heat sources, as clinker exhaust heat is. Specific technological challenge for this project is to develop a Waste Energy Recovery Boiler (WERB) that will be able to operate efficiently in the highly demanding and aggressive conditions of clinker cooler exhaust gases area. High dust content and abrasiveness of clinker exhaust gas presents very demanding environment for reliable WERB operation. Integration of developed WERB system in existing Clinker Cooler process line and interface with ORC 1.5MWe plant in overall WHRS unit is next technology challenge.

At the same time we will benefit from the exclusive position to produce, commercialise and control the exploitation of an innovative cutting edge technology into the EU and worldwide markets. Also, important benefit is ecological improvement of our environment, e.g. less CO2 and heat disposal into atmosphere.\nHence with this paper we are proposing a product that will still remain profitable even with future lower electricity energy tariffs through incentives, resulting with estimated benefit and savings for the SME-AG members for each year/foundry of about 170kEUR/year with additional 600 tons of CO2 savings/foundry/year.\nTherefore the strategic overall objective of the project is to develop a cost effective and low maintenance Waste Heat Recovery system for Power Generation in the Foundry Industry. The designed Waste Heat Recovery system (WHRS) will be based on ORC process, primarily attached to the waste heat sources within the foundry plants, ultimately to produce electrical energy and sell it directly to the power grids or use it for internal consumption purposes.

Fuels are burnt to create this heat, much of which is released unused into the environment along with carbon dioxide pollution.\n\nOne solution, both economically and environmentally, would be to reuse excess or waste heat for electricity production or other internal applications. The 'Waste heat recovery power generation based on ORC technology in foundry industry' (http://www.foundenergy.eu (FOUNDENERGY)) project, which is funded by the EU, was set up to achieve this.\n\nProject researchers are tasked with developing a cost-effective and low-maintenance waste energy recovery boiler (WERB) suited to the extreme environment of a foundry. The WERB will transfer thermal energy from the flue gases of the furnace to fluid inside an evaporator within a turbogenerator.\n\nThe first completed objective was the development of a protective coating for the WERB heat exchanging pipes. Researchers are now developing three different WERBs designed to function at different power ranges and in various situations.\n\nAnother part of the project is dedicated to building a complete waste heat recovery system (WHRS) for power production in foundries. An advanced guidance and control system for the WHRS is under development as well.\n\nIt is estimated that the implementation of such systems could significantly cut operational and energy costs while benefiting the environment. Once realised, the competitiveness of small and medium-sized foundries will be boosted significantly.", null, "http://www.greenbankgroup.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/148671.jpg", "fp7_101115_984453777"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DE11"}
