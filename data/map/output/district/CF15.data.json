The participants haven't yet been selected even though all curriculum areas have identified target groups of learners and there are some draft training plans already in place for some organisations.  \r\n\r\nActivities \r\nThe participants will undertake two week training periods in companies/businesses/primary schools in 9 European countries.  The sample training plans that have been developed for this application have been produced jointly by the sending and the receiving organisations.

While the evolution otrainees\u00b4 mobility level has reached 10% of the total amount ,  teachers\u00b4 mobility is very low and does not meet the minimum desired .We  need to boost the mobility of Vocational Training teIkaslan Araba  submits this proposal with the aim to invite teachers of vocational training throughout the CAV , who are working on innovation projects in TKNIKA ( Insitute of Innovation and applied research for Vocational Education and Training ). About 200 teachers take part in innovation projects developed in TKNIKA .They  work part-time at the center and half a day in TKNIKA in the development of these projects that  have an average duration of two years.\r\nThe projects developed cover a wide range of specialties. Some projects are technological, others are projects that have to do with management , others with teacher training and other tools for the development of e -learning and / or the Information Technology and Communication . The main objective of these projects is to reduce as much as possible the time between an innovation arises and access to vocational training schools . Teachers working in these projects design materials and training that teachers need to catch up in these areas for innovation.\r\nThere are two other very important needs that we meet with the development of this project: How does the design of technological following up system that can result in the development of projects and how you design system knowledge transfer emerged after project completion \r\nAnnually there are up an average of 45 projects under development in which the 200 teachers work .

It is dedicated to vocational education and training in different levels and it is located in the Madrid region. Our school and teachers have experience in finding work placements since 1998. Furthermore, the school and the teachers have built along the years a wide network of almost 600 companies. Indeed, we have a trustworthy and long established relationship with those companies which have provided our school with many work placements for our students. Teachers in charge of the work placements are very reliable, communicative and very quick at solving problems. Moreover, they are used to work with companies and monitor students. Our teachers have the social skills needed in order to handle excellent work placements.\r\nBecause of our desire to improve in a European level, in 2012 a team work was created to carry out projects and in 2014 the Erasmus charter for Higher Education besides the first Erasmus project were obtained. As a consequence of the great success, the following year we got it again but for 24 months. In 2017 our target is to achieve it once again in order to ask for the Erasmus+ Vocational Education And Training Mobility Charter.\r\nThis projects contains two activities:\r\n1. Vocational training for one month at workplace in a European Country: the students are around 17 and 22 years old and study Vocational Education Training on commerce, administration, electromechanics, body work repairs, electronics and electricity. 40 students will be sent between 2018 and 2019. \r\n2. Staff mobility for 5 days in a job shadow in colleges: 12 teachers of the different fields studied at ECAM will pay attention to the differences between the way we work in Spain and the work in other European countries so that they can bring us the knowledge and methods to be applied in our school.\r\nBoth activities will be developed in France, Romania and Wales so we will promote the multilingualism. \r\nRegarding the staff involved, a well-prepared mobility team has been created and it is formed by a coordinator, the principle, two head teachers and an economic counsellor\r\nOur desire is both to open our school to the European dimension and to collaborate on achieving  some European objectives such as helping young people to be more qualified and answer qualified workforce demand of entreprises, to take part in an international experience and to enhance employability and improve career prospects at a local, national, European and international level, avoid the early school dropout and encourage students to go on studying a Higher Degree. The students must develop practical knowledge related to their field of study, acquire corporate culture and practical knowledge besides relate it to theory, develop autonomy, improve foreign language competences, enhance intercultural awareness, foster awareness of the European project, increase motivation to take part in future education or training after the mobility period abroad, improve learning performance, increase his/her sense of initiative, self-empowerment and self-esteem. This project will also enhance employability and improve career prospects. Moreover, this mobility project will strengthen cooperation between companies and schools and enhance social cohesion \r\nThe objectives staff mobility must achieve are the following: share teaching practice and improve the skills related to their professional profile, improve both their training  as well as the European education system knowledge, their language skills, their job opportunities, enhance intercultural awareness, promote excellence in teaching, develop innovative teaching methods, learn  how to fight against bullying and pass on what they have learned during the staff mobility period to students and teachers.\r\nThe programme will have an impact and some benefits on students, teachers and our school. The impact on our students is : motivation increase to take part in future education or training after the mobility period abroad, improvement of learning performance, reduction of school dropout, employability enhancement and improvement of career prospects, self-empowerment and self-esteem increase, personal and educational enrichment through the experience and promotion of the European values.\r\n The impact on our teachers is: enhancement of teaching practice, trigger changes in terms of modernization and internationalization in their educational organizations, motivation and satisfaction  increase in their daily work and broaden their horizons.

To fulfill these goals, the college is a learning organisation, a learners network, which includes both the students, teachers and other personel. These goals can be supported with international activities. \r\nThe mobility periods affect the learners attitudes, build up strenght and willingnes to try. They give its participants a possibility to work in varied environments and working cultures. International activities enhance creative and critical thinking, understanding of diversity and active citizenship. Mobility periods are also seen to increase tolerance for uncertainess and ability to evaluate ones work and working habits. All these are seen as assets to cope with the changes in the work. \r\n\r\nThe mobility periods are a recognized part of the students studies. The gained competences in ones field of study, language and cultural knowldge as well as informal knowledge are integrated into the studetns study path. These has been made possible with a curriculum done in Helsinki vocational College. The project also gives a chance to continue the work to broaden the use of ECVET in new fields and new study modules.  \r\n\r\nThis application is for 80 student mobilities and 25 staff mobilities for the academic year of 2017-2018. \r\nThe previous project STADI=ILO gives still an opportunity for approximately 60 students and 5 staff members to participate. These demanded numbers are in lign with the strategic aim of a modest increase in participation to the mobility periods. The participants will be from all sectors of Helsinki Vocational college and doing their training in the curriculum or competence based education. These numbers support the strategic aim of giving equal opportunities for the students as the mobility periods for the students last from 2 to 10 weeks. The shorter periods are planned for apprentices, entrepreneurs and students with families where as the longer periods are for studyfields where the work includes projects.  \r\n\r\nThe staff mobilities will reinforce the international competences in the everyday life of the college and are seen as a mean for pedagogical development.
