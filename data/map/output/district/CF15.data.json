Exposure levels will then be used to estimate risk of disease associated with such changes.  Tools will include novel methods for processing of sewage, effluent and water samples, for quantitative detection of the target viruses, and for the determination of the source (human or animal) of viral pollution.  Models will be adapted from existing epidemiological models for viral disease in the community, or will be generated de novo as required.

The consortium members will scale-up the production of rhBMP6 from an already developed working cell bank to enter clinical trials on bone regeneration.\n\nThe bone diseases we will treat locally with OSTEOGROW are acute radius fractures and healing of distraction gap in high tibial osteotomy (HTO). These conditions are widespread and highly debilitating diseases for which such therapy holds great promise.\n\nWorkflow: Preliminary pre-clinical data are already available, and clinical grade (GMP) rhBMP6 will be available before the beginning of the project to perform toxicology studies and to determine the final formulation of OSTEOGROW. Clinical trials will start within 18 months from the start of the project funding.\n\nBusiness strategy: SMEs Genera Research, Vitrology Limited and Meditox will test and validate the rhBMP6 production in their facilities.

To avoid treatment failures and undesirable side-effects, new therapies are needed. Recently, a therapeutic product called OSTEOGROW demonstrated good healing potential in pre-clinical animal testing. \n\nThe EU-funded project 'Novel bone morphogenetic protein-6 biocompatible carrier device for bone regeneration' (http://osteogrow.eu/ (OSTEOGROW)) evaluated therapeutic potential in pre-clinical models and clinical settings. Clinical trials will include patients with acute radius fractures and those requiring surgical correction of various deformities of the lower leg to prevent osteoarthritis of the knee.\n\nThe OSTEOGROW therapeutic product has a carrier made from the patient's peripheral blood, called whole blood coagulum derivative (WBCD) to ensure biocompatibility. Recombinant human BMP-6 (rhBMP-6) is the bioactive molecule that binds to WBCD components and stimulates bone formation.\n\nThe OSTEOGROW team focused on improving rhBMP-6 production by using a genetically stable cell line suitable for commercial manufacturing. A new rhBMP-6 production and purification processes are efficient, robust, and inexpensive. The purified rhBMP-6 protein is bioactive, contaminant-free and stable in freeze-dried form. \n\nQuality and performance tests on rhBMP-6 revealed no biocompatibility or other issues. As a result, scientists finalised the formulation of OSTEOGROW with in\u00a0vivo testing showing highly promising results in mice, rats and rabbits.  \n\nClinical protocol design for Phase\u00a0I and II studies has also been completed. Currently, project partners are working on selecting the manufacturers for the now-patented kit components and are preparing the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier and Investigator\u2019s Brochure. \n\nProject activities will ensure that the commercialisation of this therapeutic product is a step closer to reality for wide-ranging orthopaedic applications in humans and animals.

Increased understanding of cancer biology, coupled with the implementation of \u201comics\u201d-based approaches, has revealed that cancer must be considered a heterogeneous disease. Historically, \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approaches have been standard practice in CRC treatment, but with the increased understanding of the molecular/genetic heterogeneity of CRC, it is clear that novel treatments must be developed and tested in selected subgroups to maximize the benefit of these new developments.

OSTEOproSPINE is a novel bone regeneration therapy composed of OSTEOGROW (recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 6 [rhBMP6] delivered in autologous peripheral blood coagulum) reinforced with allograft (a compression resistant matrix). OSTEOproSPINE is designed to guide the formation of new bone at extra-skeletal site and replace autograft harvested from patient\u2019s iliac crest for the fusion of lumbar vertebrae. By generating new bone, OSTEOproSPINE will restore the spine\u2019s weight bearing function, reduce the severity of back pain and improve the success rate of posterolateral spinal fusion surgery. The program consortium of 13 partners from 6 EU member states has been assembled to conduct a Phase II, randomized, patient- and evaluator-blinded clinical trial of OSTEOproSPINE. Four clinical centers will enroll 180 patients suffering from degenerative disc disease to assess OSTEOproSPINE efficacy and safety in comparison with Standard of care (autograft) and Osteogrow. The Ethics Committee of the leading clinical site in Vienna has already granted a conditional approval for this trial. As the coordinating institution of the FP7 HEALTH project Osteogrow (Grant No. 279239), we have evaluated Osteogrow in Phase I/II clinical trials for distal radius fracture and high tibial osteotomy. Osteogrow exhibited excellent safety profile in these trials, supporting OSTEOproSPINE safety for administration in humans.
