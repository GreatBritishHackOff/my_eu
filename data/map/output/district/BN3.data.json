The project also relies on a high profile advisory board, made of members of worldwide relevant organizations involved in the fight against cyber crime and cyber terrorism. The wide consortium as well as the advisory board, will ensure the involvement of all the possible stakeholders, by allowing to have a clear and complete picture of the real priorities.

However, whilst some hybrid structures do exist, these are typically combinations of relatively isotropic materials, which only go part of the way to optimising the amount of materials used in the structure. The ideal structure has different combinations of composite materials in predetermined locations in a hybrid multi-material structure, but to date this has not been achievable because cost-effective manufacturing processes have not been available.\n\nThe concept of this project is therefore to develop the design methodologies, manufacturing processes, equipment and control systems needed for localised placement of different fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composite tapes onto different substrates, creating locally reinforced components that are fully weight-optimised.  To achieve this, the project will focus on development of the Automated Tape Laying (ATL) process to selectively place reinforced thermoplastic tapes in 3 manufacturing routes:\n\n\u2022 Selective reinforcement of existing components\n\u2022 Direct additive manufacture of components\n\u2022 Manufacture of selectively reinforced tailored blanks for compression moulding\n\nThe manufacturing process developed will have a significant effect on the weight of structures, as for the first time it will allow different reinforcement fibres (polymer, glass, carbon) to be used synergistically in the same thermoplastic polymer matrix, to produce hybrid multi-material structural components with optimised performance and weight.", 86087.0, 3124702.0, "STELLAR", null, null, null, null, "http://www.cgtech.com", null, "fp7_109190_952231250"], ["1DD", "Inclusive Future-Internet Web Services", "Public-I Group Ltd", "I2Web will provide tools to develop inclusive Future Internet service front-ends to\u00a0 address the challenges of ubiquitous/mobile Web, media convergence and user-generated content, in combination with cloud computing and Web 2.0, Social Networking, using User-Centred Design and Design for All (DfA)/Inclusive Design principles.
