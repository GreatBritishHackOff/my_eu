However, data sources are typically fragmented and contain information gaps which prevent their full exploitation. EMIF aims to address this by developing a common Information Framework that enables improved access to these data sources, enhancement through linkage of the different sources and collection of additional new information. EMIF will focus on two specific research objectives in order to guide the development of the Information Framework:  identification and evaluation of biomarkers i) of the risk for metabolic complications in obesity; ii) of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease onset in the preclinical and prodromal phase, which in both cases will identify high-risk individuals for future intervention trials. To achieve this, a variety of data sources ranging from small-scale information-rich disease cohorts for biomarker discovery to large EHR data for population characterisation and biomarker validation will be utilised. An extreme phenotype approach will utilise the subpopulations at the extremes of a particular trait distribution using large-scale metabolomics and proteomics for biomarker evaluation. The development of the Information Framework will involve addressing data standards, semantic interoperability as well as ethics, data privacy, legal issues and the development of an IT platform for multi data sources access. The Information Framework will be designed to support the current research objectives, but more generally studies using human health data. The project consortium is a partnership between Academia and EFPIA and comprises a large number of world-renown experts in data access and linkage and the Metabolic and AD therapeutic areas, with many being involved in other related projects", null, 43952959.0, "EMIF", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ealinghospital.nhs.uk", null, "fp7_203707_953939420"], ["3HW", "Family-based intervention to improve healthy lifestyle and prevent Type 2 Diabetes amongst South Asians with central obesity and prediabetes", "Ealing Hospital Nhs Trust", "South Asians, who represent one-quarter of the world\u2019s population, are at high risk of type-2 diabetes (T2D). Intensive lifestyle modification (healthy diet and physical activity) is effective at preventing T2D amongst South Asians with impaired glucose tolerance, but this approach is limited by high-cost, poor scalability and low impact on T2D burden. \nWe will complete a cluster-randomised clinical trial at 120 locations across India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the UK. We will compare family-based intensive lifestyle modification (22 health promotion sessions from a community health worker, active group, N=60 sites) vs usual care (1 session, control group, N=60 sites) for prevention of T2D, amongst 3,600 non-diabetic South Asian men and women with central obesity (waist\u2265100cm) and/or prediabetes (HbA1c\u22656.0%). Participants will be followed annually for 3 years. The primary endpoint will be new-onset T2D (physician diagnosis on treatment or HbA1c\u22656.0%, predicted N~734 over 3 years). Secondary endpoints will include waist and weight in the index case and family members. Our study has 80% power to identify a reduction in T2D risk with family-based intervention vs usual care of: 30% in South Asians with central obesity; 24% in South Asians with prediabetes; and 24% overall. Health economic evaluation will determine cost-effectiveness of family based lifestyle modification for prevention of T2D amongst South Asians with central obesity and / or prediabetes. The impact of gender and socio-economic factors on clinical utility and cost-effectiveness will be investigated.\nOur results will determine whether screening by waist circumference and/or HbA1c, coupled with intervention by family-based lifestyle modification, is an efficient, effective and equitable strategy for prevention of T2D in South Asians. Our findings will thereby provide a robust evidence base for scalable community-wide approaches to reverse the epidemic of T2D amongst the >1.5 billion South Asians worldwide.", null, 3004993.0, "iHealth-T2D", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ealinghospital.nhs.uk", null, "h2020_194100_953939420"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["3HW", "R1K", "A&E - EALING HOSPITAL NHS TRUST PRESCRIBER"], ["3HW", "R1K", "EALING HOSPITAL"], ["3HW", "R1K", "EALING HOSPITAL COMMUNITY SERVICES"], ["3HW", "R1K", "URGENT CARE CENTRE EALING HOSPITAL"], ["3HW", "RP6", "MOORFIELDS EYE CENTRE AT EALING HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "UB1"}
