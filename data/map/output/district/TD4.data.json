In the context of a serious crisis in the construction sector, significant savings in production costs and the optimisation of yield through the use of machine strength grading systems can help SME sawmills survive. However, the current cost of machine strength grading systems (from \u20ac100.000 - \u20ac500.000) is prohibitive for SMEs. WoodSonics proposes a cost-efficient machine grading system (\u20ac60.000) using an innovative rolling ultrasonic transducer array which can be placed directly on the grading line to automatically grade the strength of the timber. Additionally, WoodSonics can detect and localise internal and external defects throughout the length of the board. The detection of localised defects allows sawmills to optimise their yield by removing defects and upgrading the quality of the timber, as well responding to specific client requests by separating defect-free wood within the same strength class. WoodSonics will be validated using spruce (the timber used in 90% of contruction) and chestnut, a high-value hardwood from the Mediterranean region.", 23712.0, 1223024.0, "WOODSONICS", "Ultrasound detects timber knots", "Recognised grade marking on timber can significantly enhance sawmill profitability but automated systems are quite expensive. Novel low-cost ultrasound technology will make machine strength grading possible for small companies, who are currently experiencing difficulties due to the current economic downturn.", "The serious downswing in the construction sector has had significant impact on the timber industry that supplies the structural wood products. Machine strength grading systems that grade wood quality quickly and effectively are cost-prohibitive for most small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), typically requiring an investment of up to EUR 500 000.\n\nMost SME sawmills have had to rely on highly inferior visual inspection until now. Currently, less than 300 machine grading units are in operation across the 35,000 sawmills located in the EU. The EU-funded project 'A cost-efficient, automated, machine strength grading system for sawn timber' (http://www.woodsonics.eu/ (WOODSONICS)) aims to overcome this deficit by developing novel in-line ultrasound technology costing around EUR 60 000.\n\nThe system will have ultrasonic roller transducer sensors installed on the sorting line so production is not disrupted. It will move along the length of the timber to detect and localise knots and then automatically grade the sawn timber board.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, engineers designed the ultrasound transmitter and receiver for the specified application and fabricated a water-coupled ultrasonic array system. Wood samples were immersed in a water tank and scanned. Mathematical models were then used to optimise the array configuration. The team has now designed the final dry contact system which is presently under construction.\n\nWOODSONICS low-cost automated wood inspection technology will have major impact on EU SMEs in the timber processing sector. The technology will efficiently detect defects for easy removal and quality upgrade of the remaining board. Besides enhancing consumer confidence, this will enhance market appeal and enable more competitive selling prices for the timber products.\n\nOverall, the sector will now be able to strengthen its penetration of existing markets and break into new ones. The relief brought by a major financial boost to an industry hard-hit by the building crisis is difficult to overestimate.", "http://www.woodsonics.eu/", "http://www.bsw.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/148156.jpg", "fp7_106804_953476439"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TD4"}
