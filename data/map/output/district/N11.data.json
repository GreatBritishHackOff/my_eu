The aim of this project is to bring together two young people groups, comparing each other's living worlds with the main theme of developing a female identity, following the themes of racism, exclusion and discrimination of black women in the two European cities.\r\nThe exchange project called Foreign Sisters discusses the problems you face as a growing black woman in a big European city. And to render young people vulnerable to these social issues. Eleven in this project is that there will be two exchange projects. Kori will travel to Amsterdam in October 2017 for an exchange with Interlock. Next, Interlock will travel to London in April 2018 for an exchange with KORI. We think it is important that the intended results from the 1st exchange of October 2017 in Amsterdam are evaluated and continued in London during April 2018. It is necessary that both youth groups perceive each other's living worlds on the spot and implement them in practice through exchange activities. Each exchange group consists of an average of 16 young people and 4 supervisors. The exchange activities consist of the following elements: meeting meetings with intercultural games, group dynamics, debates and informal conversations, workshops resilience and empowerment, youth center visits and historical sights such as a visit to the Tropenmuseum, the Black Archives museum, evaluation meetings, visit to the activities of the Black Achievement Month and culinary evening.", "http://www.kori.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-NL02-KA105-001752_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "N11"}
