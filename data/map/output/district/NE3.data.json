Despite new therapeutic principles (e.g. the use of pluripotent stem cells, regenerative medicine and treatments based on personalised medicine or biosimilars) or regulatory initiatives to enable more efficient production, such as Quality by design (QbD) with associated Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tools , the slow progress in the development of new bioactive compounds still limits the availability of cheap and effective medicines. In addition, the competitiveness of European (bio)pharma industry is impacted by the unavailability of suitably trained personnel. Fundamental changes in the education of scientists have to be realised to address the need for changes in the traditional \u2018big pharma\u2019 business model and the focus on \u2018translational medicine \u2013 more early stage clinical trials with patients, more external innovation and more collaboration\u2019 . These changes in education should be based on combining cutting-edge science from the early stage of product development through to manufacturing with innovation and entrepreneurship as an integral part of the training. The Rapid Bioprocess Development ITN, employing 15 ESRs, brings together industrialist and academic experts with its main aim to address this critical need by developing an effective training framework in rapid development of novel bioactive molecules from the very early stages of potency and efficacy testing to the biomanufacturing process characterisation and effective monitoring. The main focus of the research is on oncology related proteins and recombinant proteins to be used in diabetes treatment, although the resulting monitoring and modelling methods will be applicable to other bioactive molecule process development as demonstrated by validation on a range of relevant bioactives.", 224574.0, 3319025.0, "Biorapid", null, null, null, null, "http://www.alcyomics.com", null, "h2020_193983_969091305"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1EB", "Staff development to enhance Teaching and Learning of Spanish.", "Archibald First School", 3559.0, "As a direct result of new Government requirements to make progress in a single language at KS2 the school needed to change from teaching German to Spanish as agreed with middle school and first school colleagues within the Gosforth pyramid. \r\n\r\nThe school currently does not have a specialist in the subject and therefore has identified the need for:\r\n\r\nDevelop the teaching and learning of Spanish  and to raise the level of expertise of the teachers involved as well as develop their cultural understanding.\r\n\r\nThe School has selected a structured training course to help with meeting it's objectives. Specifically the school has selected  two staff, the MFL teacher who is not a Spanish speaker and teh Early years foundation stage  teaching assistant,   for whom it was felt that it would be beneficial to further develop her skills by attending a structured language course in Spain for teachers of Spanish. After working closely with colleagues from the middle school to launch Spanish in the school and after considerable personal study it was felt that it would be beneficial to seek professional development in Spain.

There will be an opportunity to improve Spanish language skills,explore a variety of effective teaching and Learning styles, including ICT, and share resources and expertise at school and Trust level. Accessing a highly structured programme tailored to the needs of the participants it is hoped that staff will return with a love for all things Spanish, up to date cultural awareness following visits and excursions as well as improved confidence in the spoken language. This is a huge asset for the communicative classroom. There will also be an opportunity to visit a school and make a link with Spanish colleagues. All of the above will impact on the pupils of this teacher and classroom assistant. \r\n\r\nHaving two members of school staff attend the training doubles the potential for longer term benefits in the event of staff movement and increases the scope for staff development within the school.

We are committed to Erasmus + mobility project: \"Towards new linguistic horizons\" to improve our plurilinguism program by learning from other European centers, exchanging experiences and didactic materials for language learning. And in this way reinforcing the European dimension between our centers.\r\nOur project proposes four mobility courses: two courses and two job shadowings jfor a total of 8 teachers with are interested in improving their level of competence in a foreign language, learning the CLIL methodology and strengthening their European dimension.\r\nIn the course that will be developed in England in Leeds: \"CLIL in Leeds: Content and Language Integrated Learning\", related to CLIL methodology we intend that teachers acquire competence and skills in English language teaching through this methodology to be able to apply it later in our center. They will take the course in an environment where they can meet teachers from other countries also interested in teaching foreign languages and also acquire some skills and fluency in English that will motivate him to form and to be accredited in this language later.\r\n          The course to be held in Ireland  in Dublin; \u201cIntensive English course and CLIL for teachers\u201d will provide the opportunity to learn methods of language teaching, through a motivational methodology to contribute to the acquisition of CLIL skills. This knowledge will be productive for both all our teachersr of the center for our future achievement and development of the center's plurilinguism program.\r\nThrough this course will also work skills to find resources in English for different subjects as well as ideas to motivate our students to read in English and solutions to evaluate students.\r\nIn the Job Shadowing at \"Archibald School\" in Newcastle\r\n We want to observe how the contents of the English language in subjects such as art, physical education and science (CLIL) are integrated in the center.\r\nWe will observe and learn from the methodology in the teaching and learning of Spanish as a foreign language that they teach as a second language in their educational center of Newcastle.\r\nThrough this job shadowing we can benefit the entire center of CEIP La Xara as we will acquire new practices concerning the teaching of foreign languages in addition to all of this we can also contribute  them with our experience.\r\nAt the B\u00fclseschule center in Gelsenkirchen, Germany doing a Job Shadowing\r\nWe want to observe how they integrate in the center the contents in English language in art and science (CLIL) that are languages that they teach in the center as a bilingual way from the 3 and 4 years old.\r\nWe intend to observe and learn from the methodology in the teaching and learning of English as a foreign language that they teach as a second language in their center of Gelsenkirchen to students with language learning difficulties.\r\nOur project will be developed in three phases:\r\n- The preparation phase, which will include information and selection of candidates, teacher training and logistical management of the project\r\n- Phase of execution that will consist in the accomplishment of the 4 mobilities always supervised and in contact with the coordinator of the project\r\n- Monitoring and evaluation phase in which the activities carried out will be evaluated and the project will be projected and disseminated for its efficient impact in the short, medium and long term.\r\nWe hope with this project an impact on our teachers in terms of a new vision and acquisition of CLIL methodologies in teaching-learning of foreign languages and the improvement ot their English language skills that will affect our students and consequently our entire educational community, in the way of assessing and appreciating foreign languages and in the correct involvement of our plurilinguism program.
