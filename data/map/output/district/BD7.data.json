Self-organization and social entrepreneurship are on the verge of becoming a massive global phenomenon, which highlights a need for in-depth research into their organizing, leadership and ethical processes and practices. The project aims to examine and propose new ways of theorizing leadership and organizing within the context of value-based ecopreneurship and leadership. The research objectives take on a sharp focus in today\u2019s society because of the challenge social ecopreneurs play in creating viable organizations with a social mission to create and maintain sustainable communities that support well-being. Tasks, relationships and accountability are less clear than in business organizations and require a deeper, more nuanced understanding of leadership and organizing processes. Ethical leadership and action is integral to these community-based organizations.  This will require a longitudinal research project, based on in-depth qualitative data collection that will develop and advance theory, practice and potentially methodology. The study will explore and compare Polish and UK organizations adhering primarily to an ethical system concerned with sustainability and ecology. Such a comparison has not been done before, yet is apposite because of cultural, economic and organizational differences.

A chronic state of inflammation in certain brain areas involved in mood regulation could cause mood imbalance, as a result of hormonal or metabolic disturbance. For example, immune activation could impair the catabolism of tryptophan, an important precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin. \n\nThe EU-funded http://moodinflame.eu/ (MOODINFLAME) study was designed to test the underlying hypothesis that many mood or psychiatric disorders are triggered by increased susceptibility to inflammation. Their objective was to study immune dysfunction in psychiatric patients and mouse models of disease and develop brain and blood scans for assessing immune dysfunction.\n\nLarge number of patient samples were analysed. Results linked mood disorder with increased numbers of monocytes expressing both pro- and anti-inflammatory genes as well as high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. All this data validated the overall immune dysfunction pattern in patients with mood disorders. Interestingly, an activated state of monocytes negatively determined the outcome of anti-depressant therapy.  \n\nWork in animal models of depressive-like behaviour further corroborated these findings. Animals exhibited activated inflammatory responses and an abnormal tryptophan metabolism. Scientists identified three major pathways that were implicated in the aberrant immune-endocrine interface. This abnormal communication led to structural and functional deficits of important brain regions.\n\nRegarding therapeutic strategies, part of the MOODINFLAME work entailed the screening of various non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs in the animal models.

The SANDRA project will design, implement and validate through in-flight trials an integrated aeronautical communications system based on an open architecture, a common set of interfaces and on well-proven industry standards.

At the same time, it must maintain or improve current safety standards while reducing costs to sustain international competition.\n\nThis is the reason why the EU launched the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) programme, part of the Single European Sky initiative, to come up with a new approach to reform the air traffic management (ATM) structure in Europe. In this context, the EU-funded project 'Seamless aeronautical networking through integration of data links, radios, and antennas' (http://www.sandra.aero (SANDRA)) researched and developed a promising new communication system. It validated software architectures and system technologies able to cope with next-generation transportation and Internet systems for both passenger communications and in-flight entertainment.\n\nThe system offers data and digital voice links between the aircraft and ground stations or service providers through a fully Internet Protocol (IP)-based network. In technical terms, all links carry IP packets, while the avionic radios' structure and functions can better handle IP packet-based communications. Moreover, the radio system is modular and adaptable to all current and future aeronautical radio communications systems.\n\nTo disseminate its results, the project released them in a publication that is available online and free of charge to all interested parties.

Europe is the world leader in plastics recycling and the second worldwide plastic producer, but competence by emerging industrialised nations, such as China, is growing bigger and represents a major thread for European interests in mid and long term. There is recently a big concern towards the recycling of wasted materials, including plastics. Despite the growth of recycled materials in the polymer sector, there are presently two main factors that prevent a higher use of recycled materials: Uncertainty in fixing final product density and quality of the final product, which is directly affected by viscosity of the blend. Yet despite this tremendous competition, many polymer processes still rely on trial and error for their optimisation, leading to the creation of enormous tonnes of scrap during adjusting periods. Current methods, which enable only indirect measurements such as temperature, screw torque and pressure, prove completely insufficient for characterising such complex behaviour. The industry needs rapid, reliable, non-invasive and cost effective analytical methods for process control in order to ensure desired values of density and viscosity of the polymer. This project thus proposes to develop a compact, non invasive, real-time sensor based on an ultrasonic piezoelectric transducer for in-line measurements during polymer processes. POLYSENSE will be designed for suitable insertion in a standard pressure port, which will enable the in-line measurement of density and viscosity of the polymers while circulating in a molten state inside the machine allowing the prediction of the polymer behaviour and the feedback to the process control.

It withstands processing temperatures and pressures, and demonstrates good resolution and repeatability of measurements. In addition, with proper calibration, it shows promising potential for use in sensing the percentage of filler in a material.\n\nScientists tested the ultrasonic viscosity sensor in laboratory operation of extruders on several polymers and calibration liquids. The sensor was able to measure viscosity at high temperatures and provide a measurement each second despite required electronic signal processing done by computer. Accurate viscosity measurements will facilitate increased processing speeds for higher throughput without stoppages to deal with clogging.\n\nPOLYSENSE ultrasonic density and viscosity sensors for in-line measurements of polymer processing characteristics should facilitate enhanced product quality and reliability, faster throughput and reduced scrap.
