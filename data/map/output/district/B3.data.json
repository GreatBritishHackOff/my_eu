Global mobile data traffic grew 81 % in 2013 and reached 1.5 Exabyte\u2019s per month at the end of 2013, up from 820 petabytes per month at the end of 2012. Users now demand fast and affordable connectivity when and wherever they are. The growing use/ownership of laptops, tablet computers and larger smart phones has also led to an increasing demand for high quality content such as HD video on the move. \n\nCurrent satellite communications antennas cannot fully meet this large and growing need: Mechanically steerable antennas which are bulky, heavy, require maintenance and pose considerable vehicle integration challenges. Phased arrays based on military technology are too costly for commercial applications. Existing low cost antennas trade-off the cost of the antenna against the requirement for much more expensive satellite bandwidth per Mbps transmitted. Their performance is also too limited for use in certain geographical areas (particularly at large skew angles).  \n\nThe overall objective of this project therefore is to successfully refine and scale up for market readiness the world\u2019s first cost effective, electronically steerable, digital, low profile phased antenna to enable high speed satellite communications on the move. This will enable us to gain a substantial market share in the \u20ac 1.185bn Broadband Satellite Communications-on-the-Move (COTM) market and the associated antenna market which amounts to \u20ac0.39bn. Both of which are growing rapidly. We predict that we can achieve a 2.5% market share by 2020, generating total revenues of \u20ac134m and a cumulative EBITDA of \u20ac63m, creating 781 jobs. Our prototype system technology is demonstrated and proven in a relevant environment and at TRL6. This project will allow us to demonstrate the market disruptive system in an operational environment and then fully scale up the system to market readiness.", 1188090.0, 2291573.0, "Phasor", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_196407_935435118"], ["1EH", "Boosting productivity and performance in drug discovery with SEQUOIA - Semantic Query of Information Assets", "Synapse Information Limited", "Synapse Information (UK) have developed a novel semantic web technology, SEQUOIA \u2013 Semantic Query of Information Assets \u2013 allowing users to rapidly question > 100 disparate data assets in a code-free spreadsheet environment. Having proved the core platform functionality within the financial sector, Synapse now seek to apply SEQUOIA to the field of drug discovery R&D. \n\nNew drugs are required urgently to treat cancers & other rare/neurological diseases. However, costs and timescales of drug development are huge due to high failure rates. A principle barrier is the lack of real time comparison of disparate datasets, which can identify causal correlations behind reactions throughout the R&D process. Building on the prototype kernel solution, SEQUOIA targets the many high performance silos of public online drug R&D data, enabling all researchers to semantically probe these ontologies against internal R&D. Synapse therefore aim to catalyse a strategic 10 - 100\u00d7 productivity gain during the discovery phase to disrupt the \u20ac5.5 billion/yr drug discovery software market. \n\nThe overall project aims to: fulfil the further technical developments required to transfer SEQUOIA into priority sectors within drug R&D; initiate the technical and commercial partnerships with key stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry; validate performance through extended field trials; establish regulatory compliance; deliver compatibility with key user data environments; and optimise a developed product. \n\nThe proposed Phase 1 feasibility study seeks to address these requirements through: delivery of an elaborated business plan; prioritised EU market entry strategy; analysis of market-held data assets, technical development roadmap; engagement of key stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry; supply chain initiation; development of IP strategy and value model; as well as regulatory and legal roadmaps for the final phase of developments and exploitation.", 43026.0, 61466.0, "SEQUOIA-DD", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_205144_924637175"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B3"}
