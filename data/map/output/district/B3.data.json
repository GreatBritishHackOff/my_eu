Global mobile data traffic grew 81 % in 2013 and reached 1.5 Exabyte\u2019s per month at the end of 2013, up from 820 petabytes per month at the end of 2012. Users now demand fast and affordable connectivity when and wherever they are. The growing use/ownership of laptops, tablet computers and larger smart phones has also led to an increasing demand for high quality content such as HD video on the move. \n\nCurrent satellite communications antennas cannot fully meet this large and growing need: Mechanically steerable antennas which are bulky, heavy, require maintenance and pose considerable vehicle integration challenges. Phased arrays based on military technology are too costly for commercial applications. Existing low cost antennas trade-off the cost of the antenna against the requirement for much more expensive satellite bandwidth per Mbps transmitted. Their performance is also too limited for use in certain geographical areas (particularly at large skew angles).  \n\nThe overall objective of this project therefore is to successfully refine and scale up for market readiness the world\u2019s first cost effective, electronically steerable, digital, low profile phased antenna to enable high speed satellite communications on the move. This will enable us to gain a substantial market share in the \u20ac 1.185bn Broadband Satellite Communications-on-the-Move (COTM) market and the associated antenna market which amounts to \u20ac0.39bn. Both of which are growing rapidly. We predict that we can achieve a 2.5% market share by 2020, generating total revenues of \u20ac134m and a cumulative EBITDA of \u20ac63m, creating 781 jobs. Our prototype system technology is demonstrated and proven in a relevant environment and at TRL6.

By using existing and in some cases  new partnerships we are able to offer suitable placements to our students who are studying a range of level 3 vocational subjects in specialist areas to include Travel & Tourism, Sport, Hair, Beauty, Food, Hospitality and Health & Social Care. \r\n\r\nA project team will be established to include the project coordinator who will oversee the day to day running of the project and will work with a team of destination mentors as well as finance assistant, marketing experts and language coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to give students the opportunity to improve employability skills in order to increase their chances of securing employment in a highly skilled and qualified work force. The opportunity will also assist with building on other skills such as confidence and communication as well as living independently. \r\n\r\nThe plan is to send 80 students on a 3 week work placement in  Portugal, Malta, Cyprus, Denmark and France. Students are aged upwards from17 yrs old  and are from a range of backgrounds with the majority being female.  Quite a high percentage of students are from underprivileged backgrounds and this is the perfect platform for them to develop and experience an opportunity that may not be available to them through other avenues.\r\n\r\nThe placement opportunity is open to all Further Education students who are invited to apply in the form of a CV and accompanying letter. Students will go through the interview process and if successful will be offered a place on the project. Students will then attend weekly sessions with destination mentors in order to build a rapport with peers and accompanying mentors. Weekly sessions will involve team building activities, fact finding, social events and many other topics. Students will also have to attend weekly language lessons which will consider the vocational settings that the students will be working. Students will be provided with information through this preparation period about the placement and what is expected etc.\r\n\r\nStudents will be accompanied by an experienced mentor who where possible will have knowledge of the vocational area that the student will be placed.  Mentors will assess and monitor student progress whilst visiting students on placement and will offer full support and guidance. A full itinerary will be planned in advance so that students have a detailed daily account of activities. Students will work 5 days out of 7 and will attend cultural visits on other days. Students will also meet with mentors at the end of each day to evaluate events. Students will  also be required to attend a one to one tutorial  with the accompanying mentors where targets will be checked and set. \r\n\r\nStudents will be placed in a range of different settings to include travel &tourism students working as holiday reps, kiddies reps, entertainers or hotel reception. Sport students will work in Water Parks as lifeguards or in hotel leisure centres as gym instructors . Hair students will work in hair salons, hotels or college commercial salons working with their own columns. Beauty students will work in Hair & Beauty salons or 4* Spa hotels performing treatments on clients or product training in some of the Spa's. Chefs will work in large hotel kitchens or small family run restaurants of which some are Michelin star. They will work on all areas of the kitchen including prep, cooking and the passe. Baker students will work in small bakeries and patisseries making specialist breads and chocolates. Hospitaility will work in large hotels mainly front of house in busy tourist resorts. Health & social care students will work in schools, nurseries and creches working with babies and children upto the age of 6yrs.\r\n\r\nStudents will have to attend an evaluation session and meet with the project team in order to evaluate all aspects of the project. These meetings will be recorded and put onto DVD's and will be disseminated to all parties concerned including host partners. The marketing team will meet with some of the students and will complete a write up on the students experience which will be displayed on the college Website and face book. Information will also be used to promote the project in the college prospectus and during open days.\r\n\r\nThe project coordinator will be in communication either by email or skype with all host partners on a regular basis in order to ensure as much preparation as possible is completed in advance of the actual placement period commencing.  The project coordinator will book all flights, accommodation and ground handling arrangements in advance and where possible in conjunction with host partners.

The students will typically be aged between 18-20 years old and are keen to pursue a career in animal management or tourism. They critically need experience to deepen their academic learning for several reasons: to give value and meaning to their academic work; strengthen their CVs; improve employability skills; help them network with potential employers and help them decide on optimal career paths.\r\n\r\nThe students come from 4 partner colleges with which the AWDF enjoys a long standing relationship. The project builds strongly on the shared experience with these colleges over time and incorporates several innovative elements to improve the student experience: evolved preparation especially language preparation; enhanced and innovative selection processes; longitudinal integration with academic curriculum to embed the experience within the academic career of the students and provide for continued experience in Tenerife and elsewhere.  The latter achieved through development of international collaborations particularly in the tourism sector which bring together both college partners and critically their students and organisations in Tenerife in long term promotional activities.\r\n\r\n The work placements provide opportunities for complementary sector-specific training unavailable to students in the UK but readily accessible in Tenerife.  The roles include working as research guides on whale watching boats, giving talks to tourists on nature and cultural activities in Tenerife, working at the Visitor Centre in Puerto Colon, with animal rescue centres and shelters, liaising with tour operators and hotel groups, developing contacts with specialist culture, nature and activity tourism providers on a local level and supporting them in accessing the global tourist market, both in Tenerife and through the internet.\r\n\r\nStudents receive comprehensive pre-departure training in the UK and in-country orientation on arrival in Tenerife and receive pastoral support throughout the mobility to ensure success. \r\n\r\nSignificantly, the students will gain relevant subject-specific knowledge and practical experience that is directly relevant to their formal programmes of study and have exposure to alternative work environments and processes that are unavailable to them in the UK.  \r\n\r\nMany of the students come from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds and generally opportunities for them to gain work experience that provides a broader perspective of the wider world and employment possibilities beyond their immediate region are limited.  The project will add value to their college programmes and aims to support students to broaden their horizons: personally and professionally. \r\n\r\nScholarship funds, set aside by the AWDF to provide ongoing support to students showing particular ability and or enthusiasm, will be deployed to facilitate continued participation where it is perceived to be of value.\r\n\r\nLonger term benefits of participating in this mobility are that, in addition to obtaining work-based skills and knowledge, students will also benefit from an intercultural experience and personal development that strengthens their position in the labour market and their workplace readiness.    \r\n\r\nParticipants will develop personal and professional confidence, an understanding of the labour market in another European country, a set of transferable skills and an international outlook that better prepares them for employment, giving them a competitive edge when seeking employment.   \r\n\r\nThey will also be able to self-accredit on a special qualification for the European labour market, \u2018TransCSR\u2019, which recognises corporate social responsibility within the tourism industry. Additionally, participation will provide two UCAS point for university applicants.\r\n\r\nThrough participation in the mobility project, colleges will have the opportunity to develop longterm relationships with host organisations in Spain, with whom they can work to develop closer ties and possibly expand the fields in which mobility opportunities are offered. From a college perspective also, the programme will enhance their course offerings making them more marketable to potential students.\r\n\r\nAt a local and regional level, this provides young people with an enhanced training programme, providing them with experience they could never gain in local work placements, and thereby a better chance of attaining employment in the sector.  It supports drives to reduce youth unemployment and build the confidence and capacity of young people.\r\n\r\nThe anticipated impact for participating host partners is their European networks and international outlook will be developed and strengthened, so they are able to offer similar opportunities to future students and are more engaged and connected to the European labour market.", "http://www.ucb.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036106_7"], ["1JB", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY COLLEGE BIRMINGHAM", 39998.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.ucb.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY COLLEGE BIRMINGHAM", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035404_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B3"}
