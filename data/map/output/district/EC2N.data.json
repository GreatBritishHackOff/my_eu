The main goal of the network is to enhance the career development of 12 early-stage researchers and 2 experienced ones in finance-related sectors.\n\nCurrently, while recovering from the financial crisis, the European financial world and academic researchers are facing major challenges to create and apply more reliable quantitative models and methods to manage risks. Simultaneously, computationally challenging new hybrid products combining traditional financial investments with insurance policies are gaining popularity. Consequently, demand for experts in finance with superior computing skills is growing rapidly.\n\nHPCFinance consists of 7 universities and 8 companies, representing investment and insurance companies, banks, consultants, and high-performance computing solution providers. The network\u2019s US partners provide invaluable experience for benchmarking and knowledge transfer into Europe. This world-class network provides training in robust financial models and numerical methods on high-performance computing platforms with emphasis on variable annuities and asset and liability management. The intended research is not only academically but also practically relevant as the program is built around real life challenges identified together by the academic and private sector partners.

The focus of the research is on risk management, strategic asset liability management, financial models and volatility risk, numerical methods in contract pricing and HPC technologies in finance. Journal papers and a series of events have been produced supporting project findings.\n\nBy benefiting from and developing financial modelling through HPC, the fellows will be able to build a solid foundation for dealing with the future demands of the financial sector and for carrying out more robust risk management.\n\nHPCFINANCE is fusing financial engineering with supercomputing infrastructure to make the regulatory and capital environment in the financial services industry less demanding and complex.

The key driving forces for successful implementation of the programme in UK will be analysed, together with the transfer conditions, obstacles and possibilities concerning, in particular, the target groups for the programme and the process by which the programme operates. The practices developed with Accelerator programme in Spain and Italy will also be studied informing the design of even better practices for the SMEs support in UK. The core group of 6 peer-learners (2 from each innovation agency) will be established to observe transferred practices, analyse local conditions, create the strategy (DOP), provide peer-to-peer support for the implementation as well as draft deployment driven amendments to the DOP and execute dissemination of the results.", 42011.0, 42011.0, "TWINN-LC-SMEs", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_203190_933682425"], ["1PB", "Transforming Intangible Folkloric Performing Arts into Tangible Choreographic Digital Objects", "Exus Software Ltd", "Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) content means 'the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills \u2013 as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith'.

The primary difficulty stems by the complex structure of ICH, its dynamic nature, the interaction among the objects and the environment, as well as emotional elements (e.g., the way of expression and dancers' style). TERPSICHORE aims to study, analyse, design, research, train, implement and validate an innovative framework for affordable digitization, modelling, archiving, e-preservation and presentation of ICH content related to folk dances, in a wide range of users (dance professionals, dance teachers, creative industries and general public). The project targets at integrating the latest innovative results of photogrammetry, computer vision, semantic technologies, time evolved modeling, combined with the story telling and folklore choreography. An important output of the project will be a Web based cultural server/viewer with the purpose to allow user\u2019s interaction, visualization, interface with existing cultural libraries (EUROPEANA) and enrichment functionalities to result in virtual surrogates and media application scenarios that release the potential economic impact of the ICH.

INSPEC2T approach bases its conceptual foundations on EU crime prevention and Member States specific Internal Security Policies, validated research results and best practices from cooperation between police and local, regional and national communities. This is perceived as an origin to apprehend special characteristics, particularities and determinants for trust between all stakeholders. INSPEC2T is focusing on a user-centric design and development approach, and has already mobilized and engaged a critical user group mass, in EU and abroad. With special emphasis on social media, it consolidates and modernizes bidirectional communication of stakeholders, using multi-level anonymity flags and having a clear understanding of acceptability issues. Driven from accommodated transnational and multicultural best practices, it adheres to an approach where social, cultural, legal and ethical dimensions are embedded into core user centric design specifications and implementation procedures. INSPEC2T will be demonstrated and validated in 5 EU cities by a wide range of relevant stakeholders. INSPEC2T engagement and active participation is stimulated through fully dynamic, interactive and immersive training Serious Game applications that empower players to familiarize themselves with the system, gain an intuitive understanding of its functionalities and motivate their engagement in Community Policing activities.

ReCRED adopts an incrementally deployable strategy in two complementary directions: extensibility in the type and nature of supported stakeholders and services (from local access control to online service access), as well as flexibility and extensibility in the set of supported authentication and access control techniques; from widely established and traditional ones to emerging authentication and authorization protocols as well as cryptographically advanced attribute-based access control approaches. Simplicity, usability, and users privacy is accomplished by: i) hiding inside the device all the complexity involved in the aggregation and management of multiple digital identifiers and access control attribute credentials, as well as the relevant interaction with the network infrastructure and with identity consolidation services; ii) integrating in the device support for widespread identity management standards and their necessary extensions; and iii) controlling the exposure of user credentials to third party service providers. ReCRED addresses key security and privacy issues such as resilience to device loss, theft and impersonation, via a combination of: i) local user-to-device and remote device-to-service secure authentication mechanisms; ii) multi-factor authentication mechanisms based on behavioral and physiological user signatures not bound to the device; iii) usable identity management and privacy awareness tools; iv) usable tools that offer the ability for complex reasoning of authorization policies through advanced learning techniques.
