More and more do we focus our attention to personalized learning. Typical for our way of teaching are the triangulate meetings between student, parents and teacher that are at the heart of our mentoring system. HWC is in the process of realizing international education in Amstelveen. \r\nRecognizing and respecting differences is key in the development of talent. In this application we focus on these two important aspects, while we also concider the improvement of our teachers' language skills. Due to the prospect of a new school building, we view our concept of education in an international light. Specifically, we want to explore the role technology plays in effective learning and the use of formative assessment as a way to practice a growth mindset. In collaboration with Mounts Bay Academy we want to shape the international education in Amstelveen. Through jobshadowing and teaching assignments 55 of our employees will be able to further develop themselves in the aforementioned fields. Furthermore, we want to organize a number of conferences concerning personalized learning and technology. \r\nBy formalizing this application we expect to strengthen our mentoring system and the international profile of our school. We expect to increase the possibility of establishing international education for children of the international community. Finally, we expect to bring extra inspiration, with a specific focus on technology, to the design table of our new school building.", "http://www.mountsbay.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA101-035111_1"], ["3JT", "Ithaka reDesigned", "Mounts Bay Academy", 41540.0, "The project focuses on sustainable school development. It unites two Teaching Schools with established areas of excellence and experience in working with partners both in their own countries and abroad. The schools also have established practice in delivering Continual Professional Development both inside their own establishments and to other partners, and amongst the partnership there is a great deal of outstanding practice which has been used for benchmarking by other schools both nationally and internationally. \r\nIt is in this context that we are seeking to share and build on this excellence by offering training, coaching and support in each schools' strengths and taking up the opportunity of practising these new skills both int he context of the partner schools with the support of their experts and then in our home schools with continued on-line support.\r\nThe project will further share this newly acquired and developed expertise through the project website and collaboration with other partners from outside the project. We will also be offering participation in educational conference events and other CPD events in both countries with workshops run by the project participants which will be open to other members of the teaching profession. We will see 25 members of staff delivering or receiving training, undergo role-shadowing or teaching assignments. We will hold an initial meeting for the Senior Teams of each school in order to identify areas of school improvement where they can collaborate in a similar way and plan the training course. The areas which we have already identified are growth and sports mindset, modern technologies, deeper learning and mastery. We expect the project to have a wide impact on raising standards in the two schools both through the improved methodology and pedagogy of its teaching staff and through developments in the structure and leadership of the schools through the involvement of the Senior Teams and school systems through the development of support staff. We intend the results and developments which will be realised from this project to be long-term within the two schools but also within other schools locally through the Teaching School and nationally through the sharing of experiences and expertise the Academy already supports in its work with partners such as PiXL, Challenge Partners, the Teaching School Council, the Princes Teaching Institute and other recognised bodies.", "http://www.mountsbay.org", "Mounts Bay Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035948_coordinator"], ["3JT", "Traspasando Fronteras", "Mounts Bay Academy", 6703.0, "Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Valle is a bilingual  school belonging to the Foundation of Parochial Schools of the Diocese of Seville. The school is located in \u00c9cija, a 40,000 inhabitants Sevillian town and our students belong to a working families suburb with an average unemployment rate. We are a small school of 24 teachers and 333 students.\r\nRegarding the fact that we live in a world without either frontiers or geographical boundaries, the staff decided it was no possible for our students to set them up due to the lack of the resources needed to break them. It was thought that those limits could be related to the learning of languages and new technologies. If we endow our students with these tools, they will become citizens provided with all the resources needed to settle in any place around the world, no matter language nor culture, and this endowment was acquired in school directly, including every student without caring the way they learn so as to an inclusive education can be a reality in our educational community. To achieve it, the previous and most important step was the teacher\u2019s training who would turn out to be the key in transmission of the knowledge and motivation needed in learning-teaching process.\r\nRecognized our needs, it was decided to obtain the above mentioned formation across the achievement of a project KA1 of Erasmus + with the target of getting the knowledge in advanced methodologies related to languages and technologies to get them in a current and atractive way for students, who are, indeed, our true goal of our project.\r\nTo get a clear process of the project, the School Commission Erasmus + was created , basing on the skill that every member could bring to it (paragraph C.1.3). . The commission, among other responsabilities, would be in charge of deciding the criteria and the selection process in the program. The commission, with school management team altogether,  decided the mobility for 6 teachers, one of them in every Job Shadowing: Methodological Innovation in Technology and Leanguage Learning and Special Needs. It was decided that the formation should be done in September and October in order to begin the academic year with experiences in the courses or stages most suitables to implement it. The chosen teachers must be directly related to the above mentioned subjects in any way and they would carry the adquired skills to other similar subjects, that is, Phonics from Nursery and Primary Education to the rest of the stages, as for Special Needs, a teacher related to Special Needs Education would be suitable,  regarding Methodology CLIL, a teacher who teaches a NLS (Non Linguistic Subject) in stages where the bilingual education is established. Regarding the methodologies related to new digital resourses and subjects, the staff thought of a teacher belonging to secondary stage.\r\nThe above mentioned selection process  will be carried out by the Commission Erasmus+, reported in teachers' meeting, with a clear deadline for applications and selection interviews published in meeting report . In case of the same merits, the teacher  selected will be this one with more service  years in the school, for being him/her considered to be in need of recycling and learning of new methodologies.\r\nEvery Comission Erasmus +  member has been in charge of carrying out a task in the project depending on his/her role in the school and his/her ability of decision making and, as soon as the project evaluation was known , every member will carry out the task entrusted for its flawless achievement (Paragraph G. 1. of the project).\r\nAs for the impact of the project, and keeping in mind that it has been carried out to endow students with the basic tools for succesful learning of foreign languages and new technology, the school expect that teachers adquire the training needed to transmit knowledge about these resourses in a natural way into the school itself without doing any difference in ability for learning. If students find the motivation they need to demolish, among several things, language learning barriers, the project Erasmus + will be considered to be a success by our educational community, so it will have to be shared with the rest of teachers having the same concerns.  To do it, the school Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Valle will create a dissemination network  that will go from a specific level (the school itself ) to the general one (outside the school: activities in I.2.).", "http://www.mountsbay.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-036720_2"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["2SL", "Digitising the Economy through Skills Development", "Digital Peninsula Network Ltd", "This project recognises that digital skills, at all levels, have a positive impact on business performance and the local economy but that there are significant challenges for businesses in West Cornwall in providing suitable training for their workforces.
