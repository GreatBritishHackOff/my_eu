This project will address these challenges by bringing businesses together with established training providers and digital companies to design, develop and pilot new digital training programmes and new apprenticeship delivery. Businesses will be supported to utilise work experience students and graduate placements in their businesses to help them develop their use of digital technology and digital skills and share their knowledge and experience with young people by engaging with schools. Companies looking to develop their own digital training delivery either for their staff or that of their supply chain will have access to support from knowledgeable project staff experienced in the development of digital skills training.", "ESF", 641812.0, 802267.0, "esf_england_865"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TR18"}
