The notions of freedom and respect for each other\u2019s differences are key values of the European Union.  But in order to respect each other you first have to understand each other.  With our international orientation and high quality  language education we teach our pupils to understand other people  so that they can also respect them. This allows us to link the direct international surroundings of Amstelveen with the wider  world around us. And this is not limited to our bilingual department but also applies across the board to all our teaching.  We are working on improving our exam results for German and French and we are convinced that through contact with the partner schools mentioned in this application, we can improve the skills of our (language) teachers. \r\n\r\nFor us, respecting each other\u2019s differences also entails the development of talent. Together with our partner  schools and the Sportmindset company we would like to do this in an international setting with a focus on sports. A unifying factor in the partnership between these schools is that we all strongly believe in stimulating and developing  talent.  Therefore we have consciously chosen these particular schools in these particular locations. We are an experienced bilingual school and we think we can share our CLIL competences  with our partners. By means of job shadowing and teaching assignments , our own teachers can develop their skills as well. Furthermore, we are greatly interested in new digital forms of knowledge sharing via E-twinning online coaching or MOOCS. This will also strengthen our development as a teaching school. What makes us even more enthusiastic is that one of our partner schools (Mounts Bay Academy) is currently going through a similar development.\r\n\r\nWe and the partner schools mentioned  in this KA1 application would also very much like to submit  a KA2 application.

The schools also have established practice in delivering Continual Professional Development both inside their own establishments and to other partners and amongst the partnership there is a great  deal of outstanding practice which has been used for benchmarking by other schools both nationally and internationally.  It is in this context that we are seeking to share and build on this excellence by offering training, coaching and support in each schools' strengths and taking up the opportunity of practising these new skills both in the context of the partner schools with the support of their experts and then in our home schools with continued on-line support.\r\nThe project aims to further disseminate this newly acquired and developed expertise through Massive Open Online Courses  (MOOCs), the project website and collaboration with other partners from outside the project.  We will also be organising educational conferences in both  countries  with workshops run by the project participants which will be open to other members of the profession.  Each school will see twelve members of teaching staff delivering training and twelve receiving staff training in  the partner school.  This will therefore involve 24 staff from each school.  Alongside this, we will be holding a meeting in Penzance for the Senior Teams of each school in order to identify areas of school improvement where they can collaborate in a similar way.\r\nThe schools have already identified areas in which they will work and these include Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL), Sports teaching methodology including Sports for students with disabilities, the use of modern technologies in teaching and Sports and Growth Mindset. Both schools are also looking to expand their competencies in working with more able students and in teaching Modern Foreign Languages.\r\nWe expect the project to have a wide impact on raising standards in the two schools both through the improved methodology and pedagogy of its teaching staff and through developments engendered in the structure and leadership of the schools through the involvement of the Senior Teams. \r\nFinally we intend the results and developments which issue from this project to be long-term with the two schools but also within other schools both locally and nationally through the sharing of expertise the Academy already supports in its work with such partners as PixL, The Prince's Teaching Institute, Challenge Partners and the Teaching Alliance.", "http://www.mountsbay.org", "Mounts Bay Academy", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002157_coordinator"], ["3AE", "CHS explores Europe", "Hotel Penzance", 43562.0, "CHS, Centrum Humanberuflicher Schulen des Bundes Villach, is a secondary vocational school providing higher education entrance qualification and comprises the following specializations: \r\n- H\u00f6here Lehranstalt f\u00fcr wirtschaftliche Berufe (business administration)\r\n- H\u00f6here Lehranstalt f\u00fcr Kommunikation und Mediendesign (communication and media)\r\n- H\u00f6here Lehranstalt f\u00fcr Kunst und Gestaltung (arts)\r\n- H\u00f6here Lehranstalt f\u00fcr Modedesign und Grafik (fashion design)\r\n\r\nWithin the project \"CHS explores Europe\" 26 CHS students will complete their internship in various EU countries.

The school is located in \u00c9cija, a 40,000 inhabitants Sevillian town and our students belong to a working families suburb with an average unemployment rate. We are a small school of 24 teachers and 333 students.\r\nRegarding the fact that we live in a world without either frontiers or geographical boundaries, the staff decided it was no possible for our students to set them up due to the lack of the resources needed to break them. It was thought that those limits could be related to the learning of languages and new technologies. If we endow our students with these tools, they will become citizens provided with all the resources needed to settle in any place around the world, no matter language nor culture, and this endowment was acquired in school directly, including every student without caring the way they learn so as to an inclusive education can be a reality in our educational community. To achieve it, the previous and most important step was the teacher\u2019s training who would turn out to be the key in transmission of the knowledge and motivation needed in learning-teaching process.\r\nRecognized our needs, it was decided to obtain the above mentioned formation across the achievement of a project KA1 of Erasmus + with the target of getting the knowledge in advanced methodologies related to languages and technologies to get them in a current and atractive way for students, who are, indeed, our true goal of our project.\r\nTo get a clear process of the project, the School Commission Erasmus + was created , basing on the skill that every member could bring to it (paragraph C.1.3). . The commission, among other responsabilities, would be in charge of deciding the criteria and the selection process in the program. The commission, with school management team altogether,  decided the mobility for 6 teachers, one of them in every Job Shadowing: Methodological Innovation in Technology and Leanguage Learning and Special Needs. It was decided that the formation should be done in September and October in order to begin the academic year with experiences in the courses or stages most suitables to implement it. The chosen teachers must be directly related to the above mentioned subjects in any way and they would carry the adquired skills to other similar subjects, that is, Phonics from Nursery and Primary Education to the rest of the stages, as for Special Needs, a teacher related to Special Needs Education would be suitable,  regarding Methodology CLIL, a teacher who teaches a NLS (Non Linguistic Subject) in stages where the bilingual education is established. Regarding the methodologies related to new digital resourses and subjects, the staff thought of a teacher belonging to secondary stage.\r\nThe above mentioned selection process  will be carried out by the Commission Erasmus+, reported in teachers' meeting, with a clear deadline for applications and selection interviews published in meeting report . In case of the same merits, the teacher  selected will be this one with more service  years in the school, for being him/her considered to be in need of recycling and learning of new methodologies.\r\nEvery Comission Erasmus +  member has been in charge of carrying out a task in the project depending on his/her role in the school and his/her ability of decision making and, as soon as the project evaluation was known , every member will carry out the task entrusted for its flawless achievement (Paragraph G. 1. of the project).\r\nAs for the impact of the project, and keeping in mind that it has been carried out to endow students with the basic tools for succesful learning of foreign languages and new technology, the school expect that teachers adquire the training needed to transmit knowledge about these resourses in a natural way into the school itself without doing any difference in ability for learning. If students find the motivation they need to demolish, among several things, language learning barriers, the project Erasmus + will be considered to be a success by our educational community, so it will have to be shared with the rest of teachers having the same concerns.
