The College wants to encourage students to share their knowledge and professionalism in being a mobile workforce within the Child Care and Social and Health Care Sector. With its international approach the College aims at increasing the recruitment of students to attractive education programs and hereby provide appropriate challenges for the talented students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS \r\n\r\n28 students within Child Care and 19 students within Health Care. Total 47 students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANT PROFILE \r\n\r\nThe participants are young people or adults, mostly women, between 17 and approx. 40. They are in the process of an education within Child Care or Social- and Health Care.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDECRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nOn the selected location, the Health Care students will carry out 4 weeks internship at a nursing home for elderly people and the Child Care students will carry out a 8 weeks internship at a children's institution, e.g. kindergarten. The students will work side by side with the permanent staff. As our students do have a high level of professionalism in their field, they will be able to inspire their foreign colleagues with new professionalism. Through this working experience the students will be able to reflect and see their professional skills in a new context and at the same time be more aware of their own working conditions in the Danish environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS USED TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT \r\n\r\nFor each student the internship is individually planned and implemented in close cooperation with local partners in the Netherlands, Spain and England. The methods are planning, communication, evaluation and reporting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PLANNED RESULTS AND EXPECTED IMPACT\r\n\r\n\u2022 The possibility to participate in international internship will attract more resourceful students to attend the education programs at the Social and health Care School\r\n\r\n\u2022 The students will strengthen their cultural, professional and personal skills\r\n\r\n\u2022 Through cultural encounters the students will gain an understanding of the conditions in the foreign country\r\n\r\n\u2022 The student will be able to handle it their own positions in an unfamiliar cultural context. Hereby the students acquire knowledge to \"think and act for themselves\r\n\r\n\u2022 The students are personally challenged, to establish a working day in a different context and culture than the Danish.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The students acquire greater clarity in their competence to act, because they are \u201cforced\" to a deeper reflection on what she/he does in the internship situation because professional subjects needs to be explained , translated and disseminated to a supervisor from another culture.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The students will be aware of the differences between the Foreign and the Danish Health Care system.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Students will through an attachment to an English-speaking supervisor during the internship have practiced and used their English skills.\r\n\r\n\u2022 To give students the opportunity to understand and express the most basic words in Spanish and Dutch.", "http://www.almondvoclink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DK01-KA102-000083_3"], ["4BB", "A JIT m\u00f3dszer alkalmaz\u00e1sa a kereskedelemi gyakorlatban a mikro- \u00e9s kisv\u00e1llalkoz\u00e1sok eset\u00e9ben", "Almond Vocational Link Ltd", 33509.0, "Varga Istv\u00e1n Vocational Secondary School for Commerce and Economics was founded in 1987/88. Nowadays we offer secondary education in Commerce, Marketing and Business Administration for youngsters aged 14 to 19, and vocational training in Commerce for students after their secondary school leaving exams. So far, beside high standard academic studies we have aimed to give our students a life-like vocational training. \r\n\r\nParticipating in this project, we would like to provide our students - involved in vocational training and studying English as a foreign language - the opportunity to take part in working placements in the UK with the assistance of the Erasmus + programme. Thus, we intend to place 20 of our students studying Commerce, in two turns, in outlets for the duration of their compulsory training for three weeks.\r\n\r\nWe found the Almond Vocational Link, a Plymouth based non-profit organization in the database of our National Agency. We contacted them and found that they are a host organization for mobility projects, a committed team of people for organizing, managing, monitoring and evaluating work experience. They have developed extensive contacts with local businesses in many sectors, especially Commerce and Marketing. Their work experience programmes run all year round.\r\n\r\nAll beneficiaries involved in the project have finished the 4th form of our school, learning Commerce and Marketing. They are right after their final exams, thus their knowledge is adequate for working in an international environment. They are going to continue their studies in our school, so they intend to get a storekeeper qualification. Moreover, according to the central programmes of qualifications listed on the National Qualification Register (OKJ) by the National Institute of Vocational Education, the graduates will have to take the majority of their exams both in Hungarian and a foreign language as well.\r\n\r\nThe participants are going to work in commercial units on weekdays, from 9 am to 5 pm, for three weeks. The first turn will attend the internship from November 9, 2014 to November 29, 2014; while the second turn starts on July 5, 2015 and lasts till July 25, 2015. During their internship the beneficiaries will carry out the following tasks:\r\n\r\n-Meeting time arrangements and schedules of those working in the sales area.\r\n\r\n-Procuring, ordering, stocking and warehousing the goods, with special regards to the Just in Time (JIT) method.\r\n\r\n-Acquiring knowledge about selling and marketing methods.\r\n\r\n-Working at the cash desk, using cash registers properly, dealing with money.\r\n\r\n-Finding out the sales revenues, costs and turnover.\r\n\r\n-Learning new sales promotion methods.\r\n\r\n-Meeting quality standards, ways of quality control and assurance.\r\n\r\n-Learning ways of management, gaining basic executive abilities.\r\n\r\n-Dealing with customer complaints.\r\n\r\nTheir close guidance allows the participants to carry out a comparative analysis of employment conditions and recognizing the opportunities of starting a business. They can find out the activities and strategies of firms, the models of work, the working and social conditions of the people in the host country. They can realize that they are able to meet the demands of the European labour market, and they can be more conscious of their values. They can make a substantial progress in their English knowledge, thus they will be able to take English language exams in the close future.\r\n\r\nSchedule:\r\n\r\nMay-June 2014: selection of the project members, distribution of tasks and obligations, concluding agreements with the partners, selection of participants in the first turn\r\n\r\nSep 2014: concluding agreements with the participants\r\n\r\nOct 2014: vocational and language course for the first turn participants, travel arrangements\r\n\r\nNov 2014: mobility period and placements for the first turn in accordance with the working schedule and monitoring \r\n\r\nDec 2014: evaluation of the vocational training for the first turn and selection of participants for the second turn\r\n\r\nNov-Dec 2014: continuous dissemination of results in the school, local and professional communities\r\n\r\nFebr 2015: concluding agreements with the second turn\r\n\r\nMay-June 2015: vocational and language course for the second turn, travel arrangements\r\n\r\nJuly 2015: mobility period and placements for the second turn in accordance with the working schedule and monitoring\r\n\r\nAug 2015: evaluation, preparing final reports and Europass Mobility Certificates \r\n\r\nSep-Nov 2015: continuous dissemination of results\r\n\r\nDec 2015: evaluating the project, finalizing reports and ending the project\r\n\r\nImpacts:\r\n\r\n- the successful ending of the vocational training, favourable involvement in the labour market on the short term and successful carrier as an employee or an entrepreneur on the long term for the participants\r\n\r\n-widening the frames of the training, involving new contents in our pedagogical programme on the short term and making the vocational training attractive for potential partners on the long term for our institution.", "http://www.almondvoclink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-HU01-KA102-000096_1"], ["4BB", "Mo.G.E. \u2013 Mobilit\u00e0 delle Guide Ecomuseali", "Almond Vocational Link Ltd", 167520.0, "CONTEXT\r\nFigthing rising level of unemployment among young people is one of the most urgent tasks for European governments. The European Commission has actively been seeking to promote work-based learning through high-quality apprenticeships and traineeships as an effective tool for integrating young people into the labour market. Empirical evidence suggests that a stronger cooperation between the world of education and training and the world of work would be beneficial to fight high levels of young people\u2019s unemployment, by contributing to the acquisition of work-related skills and experience in close alignment with employer requirements. Indeed, students spending a training period in another country as part of their education are more prone to work abroad when they enter into the labour market.\r\nIn order to support innovation and modernisation of vocational education and training institutions, and to meet the needs of youth and employers, the partner organizations intend to develop and manage a transnational mobility project, lasting 35 days, for 60 VET learners (students in vocational training schools), in the area of sustainable tourism. In particular the abroad training content would seek to help learners acquire the full set of knowledge, skills and competences required for a specific occupation, the ecomuseum guide. The competitiveness of the European tourism industry is closely linked to its sustainability, as the quality of tourist destinations is strongly influenced by their natural and cultural environment and their integration into the local community. The ecomuseum is ascending to the European scene as one of the most innovative formula able to balance conservation and development, culture and landscape, local identity and turistic flow. In order to endorse its own heritage the Puglia Government has recently approved multiple and effective actions.\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nBriefly, the proposed project aims to:\r\n\u2022 support learners in the acquisition of the competences, knowledge and skills required to become a ecomuseum guide, as well as intercultural competences;\r\n\u2022 ensure a formal recognition of competences gained through the learning periods abroad;\r\n\u2022 enhance technical skills of learners by emphasizing on practical knowledge within training programmes;\r\n\u2022 improve learners\u2019 employability and personal growth;\r\n\u2022 improve the participants\u2019 foreign languages competence;\r\n\u2022 raise the participants\u2019 awareness of European citizenship and identity;\r\n\u2022 reinforce synergies between vocational training and employment in the field of sustainable tourism and ecomuseums.\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\nBeneficiaries of this mobility project will be 60 students attending a Tourism Course at a VET school.

Stakeholders\u2018 survey results indicate that learners as well as representatives of social partners recommend modernization of vocational training programmes. Vocational training of hair and beauty care specialists is being implemented in accordance to vocational training programmes which have been last approved more than six years ago. It is natural that during this period labour market requirements and needs have changed. Individuals training in accordance to the curriculum do not acquire competencies necessary for successful work. Meanwhile teachers who train hairdresser specialists lack for knowledge and experience in issuing innovative labour market needs satisfying vocational training programme. Selection of specialized technological trainings for teachers who train hairdressers in Lithuania is very much limited and the service is quite expensive. \r\nTo meet the needs of vocational teachers and improve quality of hairdresser training by issuing a non-formal hairdresser vocational training programme a mobility project on behalf of consortium is being carried out. The main objective of the project \u201cInnovation in EU Hair and Beauty Care Service Sector by Establishing Prosperous Conditions for Autonomous Career Development\u201d is to develop professional competencies of hair and beauty care specialists and to update vocational training curriculum by emphasising significance of  creativity and enterprise capacity education  on learner autonomous career development.\r\nProject tasks are the following:\r\n1. To develop technological competencies of vocational teachers who train hair and beauty care specialists. Development of practical skills will provide knowledge and experience for improvement of vocational practical training.\r\n2. To summarize experience obtained during the project and to issue a non-formal vocational training programme.\r\nDuring a two week internship in the United Kingdom vocational teachers will develop technological competencies in the following fields: tendencies of daily/ evening/ occasional hairdressings, modern haircut techniques, haircut styles, tendencies of hair dyeing. Participants will get ideas for improvement of vocational practical training by developing ones\u2018 practical skills. Additional activities are planned within the project. Observation of local hairdresser theoretical and practical training lessons is integrated. Observation activities will allow the teachers to find out to what extent foreign colleagues applying informational communicational technologies to hairdresser training. They will acquire knowledge in methods used for education of individual capacities such as creativity, enterprise, career planning and its autonomous development. In order to satisfy teachers\u2018 needs necessary for issuing a modern and attractive vocational training programme the practical and observation types of activities are established.

As a component of the course, internships provide an answer to the need to create working conditions for the knowledge and skills acquired at school to be tested and assessed in a real working environment. The project aims at broadening the range of this critical part of the students' studies, providing  working placements with an international context. These participants will therefore do their curricular internship period at British companies located in the area of Plymouth, for 10 weeks.\r\n\r\nBy testing and evaluating in a real working environment, internships buffer the transitional impact from school to work. If that is attained at an international level, with the appropriate linguistic, cultural and social preparation, then the skills obtained to prepare professional life acquire an added value as new opportunities arise in the European labour market. The project also provides these pre-working youngsters a solution that makes up for the saturation of the small and economically recessive Portuguese market in their professional areas, thus providing a widening of their professional expectations. \r\n\r\nThis project combines three needs that must be addressed together in order to achieve an integral and encompassing training that fully prepares students for a truly European experience:\r\n- proficiency in the \"techspeak\" of the student's area of work;\r\n- bridging the school environment to the employment environment;\r\n- providing a broadened international experience, qualification and validation that may extend the professional prospects of vocational students.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the students' linguistic skills will not only improve in the scope of the project, that is, in the specific jargon of their working area, but also in the daily use of the language, thanks to the immersion during the 10 weeks of the project.

Hyria was established in August 2009 by merging seven vocational education institutions and adult education centers. Hyria operates in the rapidly growing Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Riihim\u00e4ki region which has nearly 90 000 residents, 34 000 jobs, and 5000 companies of which many operate internationally. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe development of international operations is very important to Hyria and therefore internationalisation is one of the focus points in its strategy and operations. Student and staff mobility have been identified as critical success factors in reaching the objectives set for international activities. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe aim is to increase our students\u2019 and teacher\u2019s professional and international skills by offering them a possibility to participate in international mobility programs. By enabling our students and teachers to acquire new skills and knowledge the quality of education increases as well as student\u2019s employment opportunities. At the same time, Hyria serves the needs of the area\u2019s working life by producing a highly skilled workforce. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nObjectives and expected results\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important objective is the increase of students\u2019 professional skills, knowledge and attitudes by emphasizing the acquisition and development of key competencies of lifelong learning.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe exchange period comprehensively enables students to develop those key competencies which are needed for personal fulfillment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. During the exchange period students encounter new situations; apply already gained knowledge and language skills in practice; learn to use new technological solutions and platforms while communicating with their teachers, friends and family in the home country; and, compare working methods, the acquisition of technical solutions, the level of sustainable development and legislative issues in the host country.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, students are able to develop international and personal capabilities such as cultural awareness, language skills, interpersonal skills, individual growth, independence and the ability to work in a multicultural environment. For teachers the project activities give a possibility to update their professional knowledge and understanding of current requirements of a working life.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the help of this project the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 professional identity gets stronger, and they are able to find out more field-specific professional development possibilities. It enriches the education in many ways. It also encourages students\u2019 towards entrepreneurship and motivates them to learn languages. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second objective is to continue the development activities of the mobility processes at Hyria. This time the development activities are focus on the following issues: \r\n\r\n- Facilitate the implementation of skills demonstration/competence tests abroad (create instructions, process flowcharts etc.)\r\n\r\n- Implement the renewed mobility activities (renewed according to ECVET)\r\n\r\n- To improve ICT skills of students and teachers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMobility\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the help of the project, Hyria aims to reach its objectives for student mobility (10% of young students). The project comprises 72 4-17 weeks student mobility covering 22 fields of education and 35 educational programmes. Exchange periods are offered principally to Hyria\u2019s second or third year students (young), but also adult students, and recently graduated can participate. In addition to that we wish to send two special needs students, for collecting experiences in order to develop their international possibilities in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to long-term mobility during the project there will be two international, work life-oriented study modules, one in Finland and one in Denmark. Hyria\u2019s department of wood processing organises \"Toy design and manufacturing\" -course during which students\u2019 design and make wooden toys for the local day care centers according to children\u2019 and personnel\u2019 wishes.\r\n\r\nIn Tradium in Denmark the students\u2019 are doing bigger entities, as they participate in manufacturing of children playgrounds with the local entrepreneur. Both courses are integrated English language courses as well, implemented with the help of language teachers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeacher mobility is connected with implementation of intrnational study module, development of mobility activities (skills demonstration, ECVET) and visiting partners.

They are from various areas of training such as: Computer Science, Electricity and New Energies, Business Administration, Chemistry, and Tourism and Hospitality. Students and recent vocational school graduates reside mostly in the North Interior Pinhal region. The beneficiaries of this project are young people between the ages of 16 and 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the mobility takes place, an educational plan will be implemented which will include the different types of jobs carried out.  Then they will be presented to the school community in scheduled sessions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will provide many short and long-term benefits that will be advantageous to the young beneficiaries\u2019 level of training and qualifications.  This experience will provide them with more opportunities and enhance their regional employability.

Hyria was established in August 2009 by merging seven vocational education institutions and adult education centers. Hyria operates in the rapidly growing Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Riihim\u00e4ki region which has nearly 90 000 residents, 34 000 jobs, and 5000 companies of which many operate internationally. \r\n \r\nThe development of international operations is very important to Hyria and therefore internationalisation is one of the focus points in its strategy and operations. Student and staff mobility have been identified as critical success factors in reaching the objectives set for international activities. \r\n \r\nThe aim is to increase our students\u2019 and teacher\u2019s professional and international skills by offering them a possibility to participate in international mobility programs. By enabling our students and teachers to acquire new skills and knowledge the quality of education increases as well as student\u2019s employment opportunities. At the same time, Hyria serves the needs of the area\u2019s working life by producing a highly skilled workforce. \r\n \r\nObjectives and expected results\r\n\r\nThe most important objective is the increase of students\u2019 professional skills, knowledge and attitudes by emphasizing the acquisition and development of key competencies of lifelong learning.\r\n \r\nThe exchange period comprehensively enables students to develop those key competencies which are needed for personal fulfillment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. During the exchange period students encounter new situations; apply already gained knowledge and language skills in practice; learn to use new technological solutions and platforms while communicating with their teachers, friends and family in the home country; and, compare working methods, the acquisition of technical solutions, the level of sustainable development and legislative issues in the host country.\r\n \r\nIn addition, students are able to develop international and personal capabilities such as cultural awareness, language skills, interpersonal skills, individual growth, independence and the ability to work in a multicultural environment. For teachers the project activities give a possibility to update their professional knowledge and understanding of current requirements of a working life.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of this project the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 professional identity gets stronger, and they are able to find out more field-specific professional development possibilities. It enriches the education in many ways and encourages students\u2019 to entrepreneurship and to learning languages. \r\n\r\nThe second objective is to continue the development activities of the mobility processes at Hyria. This time the development activities are focus on the following issues: \r\n- Facilitate the implementation of skills demonstration/competence tests abroad (create instructions, process flowcharts etc.)\r\n- Moving from short-term co-operation agreements to longer ones (MOU, LOI)\r\n- Building up a partner information database for improved information flow within the organization\r\n- Creating a centralized mobility process, instructions and orientation to teachers and staff members. \r\n \r\nMobility\r\n\r\nWith the help of the project, Hyria aims to reach its objectives for student mobility (10% of young students). The project comprises 8 1student mobility (for 4-15 weeks) covering 25 vocational qualifications. Principally exchange periods are offered to Hyria\u2019s second or third year students (young), but also to adult students and recent graduates. In addition to that we wish to send two special needs students for collecting experiences. Hyria would like to develop international mobility possibilities of special need students in the future. \r\n\r\nTeacher mobility is connected development of mobility activities (skills demonstration, ECVET) and visiting partners in Italy and Denmark.

Activities of international mobility encourage the personal development, expansion of professional skills and knowledge, linguistic competences. Departure to the other country for learners offers perspectives: participants of international mobility are forced to adapt in the foreign environment; they get acquainted with other cultures, learn more about themselves, are offered possibilities of getting acquainted with principles of business organisation in foreign companies and this directly leads to the development of their better understanding of entrepreneurship. Possibility to participate in such projects often helps the learners to understand what they are aiming in their lives. Siauliai VET centre strives to increase the motivation of students, to develop the gained professional practical skills, to develop their entrepreneurship by participating in the mobility project: Siauliai VET seeks that the mobility of learners, their practical working experience in foreign VET centres (practical professional training) and organisations (practical training in the workplace) encourages the educational motivation, increases interest in the profession, develops practical \u2013 professional skills, intercultural as well as interpersonal features so that this all complex of developed skills and competences helps a young person to get ready for the work in a contemporary labour market better. \r\nUnder conclusions of the Board of Europe (meeting of Board for Education, Youth, Culture and Sport in Brussels, 20 May 2014), it is possible to state that the entrepreneurship is an important driving force for the economic growth and new workplaces: it encourages the establishment of new workplaces, opens new markets and possibilities, increases the productivity, and develops the wellbeing. Educating of entrepreneurship increases the employment possibilities for youth. Educating of entrepreneurship, especially in small and medium enterprises is the backbone of the European Union economy.

What must be organized beforehand? How are the students to be prepared? Which partners and what kind of support is required? How are mobilities organized and executed? How are students taken care of and coached? How can the experiences made be included into the daily life at school and at work? How are the mobilities going to be evaluated and deliberated? How can consequences be drawn and how can processes be optimized for following projects?

They have already proven to have acquired a fundamental knowledge of English, are at the time of the application in their second year, posess good professional ands personal skills and have already shown interest in projects of this kind. Here in Germany they are going to be prepared profoundly within the areas of language and communication, cultural knowledge and professional skills and learn, in collaboration with the foreign partner institutions and enterprises, to independently live and work in a foreign country and are going to acquire new language knowledge as well as personal and professional skills and faculties.  The project is going to be executed in close collaboration and coordination of all involved parties (apprentices, their employers, foreign partner institutions and cooperating enterprises as well as our school). For the exchange of information, especially for the communication with our foreign partners, modern communication devices and platforms such as Etwinnings are going to be used. A special focus is on avoiding disadvantages of any kind for the involved parties. Everybody will benefit by this project and all requirements of the concerned institutions and individuals will be taken into consideration. This includes aspects such as insurances, boarding and accommodation as well as travelling. All these points have already been thought about and are organized or prepared.

The process is going to be monitored permanently and evaluated at the end. This will mainly happen by the students\u2019 reports, questionnaires and SWOT analyses. During the placements, contact will be held by Etwinnings but also email and telephone are possible means of communication to be able to act quickly and be able to react spontaneously in cases of emergencies.  Extremely important for the success of a mobility is its preparation. These are going to be mainly proceeded by the employees of the vocational school in Oldenburg.

From our teaching experiences, it emerges that the most widespread deficiencies among students aged 15 to 19 are the loss of enthusiasm about their future and the lack of connection of their studies to the needs of the labour market. In a society where the youth (aged 15-24) unemployment rate rose from 10,0 % in 2012 to 43,2.% in 2014 (ISTAT) students consider the learning experience too far from real life and not linked to the world of work. In this changing and complex context, teachers have multiple roles to perform : they are expected to be not only knowledge transmitters but also coaches, facilitators, learning mentors, guidance counselors. To fulfil all these roles professionally, teachers need to be competent in their responsibility towards their students both inside and ouside the classroom at all levels: local, national and international level.OBJECTIVES It is our project priority to create a  group of highly motivated, well-prepared school professionals, closely linked to the world of enterprises and business and able to meet the challenge of bridging education and training to employment in a European perspective at the same time helping students increase  their  self-esteem, employability and entrepreneurship.We want to offer a multi-level/inter-institutional training to a group of our talented professionals : they will spend one week abroad  job shadowing VET teaching techniques, exploring models of apprenticeship /Internship and experiencing job placement techniques at VET schools and organisations, enterprises and training centers in Plymouth, Devon, United Kingdom.Upon their return they will be able to transmit their improved/acquired skills to create a quality \u201cCareer Guidance and Counseling Service\u201d and a quality \"Internship Service\"(One-Stop-Shop model)at school in order to reduce the GAP between Education,Training and Employment.Experience and expertise of grant holders will lead to a higher degree of innovation in teaching and research, as well as an increase of international cooperation capacity at both personal and institutional level.NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS : 15 in 3 fluxesPROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS : Participants are all VETschools teachers DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIESThe Project planned activities are the following:- Job shadowing ( consisting in peer coaching, peer learning and peer review activities ) /observation activities at local VET Schools and Universities on subjects of  the teachers' Sectors;- Workshops of self-reflection activities on teaching- learning practices in the field of Career Guidance and Counseling ;- Job shadowing/observation activities at Enterprises /Hotels hosting learners on their apprenticeship;- Job shadowing/observation activities at Training centers/Job centers.TITLE OF THE TRAINING ACTIVITY IN THE LANGUAGE OF TUITION : BETOE+ Bridging Education and Training to EmploymentTYPE AND ORIGIN OF THE TRAINING ACTIVITIES: JOB SHADOWING/OBSERVATION PERIOD aimed at VET StaffTHEMATIC FIELDS OF THE TRAINING: Career guidance and counseling;Combating failure in education; Fight against school failure & link school and work; Employment support.

At the same time a vineyard or a wine cellar could be a more visited site and a storytelling place. Some itineraries will  combine with others through a leitmotiv, realizing a thematic map of a country. Tourist wants to learn from the territory, becoming the protagonist and also the promoter, sharing and comparing its experience (posting photos, leaving feedback, making \"responsible\" travels).The development of our society and new communication systems shift the attention from information to the storytelling, a perfectly combination of experiences. Therefore, our wonderful natural, cultural and agri-food heritage becomes the narrative focus. In this regard, it is interesting to examine how some countries can have a relevant success in the tourism, despite their historical,  artistic, natural background and their low quality products.The abroad mobility experience is addressed to 90 young people attended the last year of High School or students that have ended it within one year, in tourism and business sector. The project aims to contribute to the professional growth of the future storyteller and the development of those sectors that can take advantage of 3.0 emotional marketing. Moreover, through the research of feelings aroused by a territory, the comparison with creative solutions and an active use of storytelling techniques, participants will be encouraged to take a new look at their country, increasing their sense of belonging and active involvement.  The participants will carry out a 3 weeks internship in the following countries: UK, Spain, Malta and Ireland. Candidates will be introduced in companies dealing with emotional marketing and storytelling; they will develop specific competences related to the process of territory storytelling, adopting the \u201cemotional\u201d strategy.Each High School will activate the recruitment of candidates through specific advertising measures. The selection process will identify candidates with the skills and competences required.The mobility preparation will last 51 hours divided into seminars (15 hours) and e-learning (36 hours).The workshops will take place at each High School with the topics listed below:1) Information about management of administrative documents and access mode to the self-learning courses and the FAD courses that will integrate experts' actions.2) Security field and emotional marketing.3) Connection between tourism and territory.4) Analysis of self-entrepreneurship and final project evaluations.It is also planned an additional FAD language course in English or Spanish.For each mobility it will be prepared an individual plan on the basis of participants' competences entry level and their personal characteristics, not forgetting, the defined learning outcomes:a) Design, definition and promotion of tourist development plans (Tuscany Region professional figures repertoire, activity area number 377).b) Adopt 3.0 marketing techniques to increase the territory value.The matching between participants and host company will be established in collaboration with our host organizations.The following project phase will concern the organization of the mobility and then the departure.

Italy is the European country with the largest number of spas thanks to its unique geology volcanic phenomena. In fact the spa and wellness tourism in Italy host  4.2% of tourists in hotels or other types of accommodation, that  means 15 million people every year. If we analyze the human capital skill in the sector, we understand that the demand for the professions, as  restaurant and bar service but also staff in marketing and fitness, increased. These companies need to be equipped by the staff with different level of skill and competences to be able to meet  the challenges presented by the market and to take advantage of  the opportunities to grow . The project TE.BE.  intends to respond to this need, by offering  an opportunity to the students and graduates of  Lazio, Tuscany, Lombardy, Puglia, Veneto and Piedmont  region to obtain an educational and professional experience in foreign companies that operate in the tourism sector of  spa and wellness in the following areas :- Tourist services: specific skill  in restaurant, bar, kitchen and technical services for accommodation;- Marketing and communication:  tourism marketing  and communication skill - Health and fitness:   spa and wellness skill;- Management and administration: management and administration skill .OBJECTIVES.  The participants involved will be able to carry out a training and professionalizing experience in international environments, which will enable them to equip themselves with a mix of interdisciplinary and interconnected skill. The project also intends to use the methods and tools for skill and credits recognition through the use of Unit of learning to be capitalized and converted into the school  and / or training credits  by measuring, recognizing, validating the LO through linear and transparent procedures according the indications  of the ECVET.NUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS80 STUDENTS.

Student mobility can be a life-changing experience and a student's statement  \"Sara, since you came back from Spain, you are much friendlier and even fun\" testifies to a profound transformation that this particular student underwent. A teacher that categorically refused to go anywhere because she could not speak the language is now asking when she is finally going to travel somewhere.

The partners are from five different countries. There are two partners in two of the countries involved because we want to optimize and enhance the opportunities that each of them offers in terms of placing young people in companies.This project will include four different kinds of training programs. The first one is aimed at vocational school graduate students completing their vocational courses; the other one is for students who are attending the second year of their vocational courses; another program is available for young graduates who have completed their courses; finally, it is also expected to carry out internships in companies and schools, involving teachers, technicians and managers of the entities that are part of the Consortium.In what regards the different mobilities, the linguistic and cultural preparation will occur before, during and after the mobilities, through face-to-face training in a classroom context and using the OLS platform.The traineeships with the duration of 6 and 10 weeks are part of the courses\u2019 curriculum and will enable these students to carry out their training in a real context of work in an European country where they can perform experiments in different contexts.The 10 months\u2019 traineeships are avalilable to graduate students, in order to create new opportunities to these young people, making their integration into the labour market easier. These trainships will shorten the effects caused by youth unemployment - a serious social problem in Portugal and in the European Union.Developing these traineeships and simultaneously implementing an individual technical project, is a way to contribute to the implementation of two challenges that are essential to fulfill the students\u2019 plan of studies.We would like to highlight that the beneficiaries of this project live and study in a disadvantaged rural region in the interior of Portugal where an infrastructure and development deficit is clear.The traineeships will occur in different phases, with different flows, starting at different times; they will be held in each of the school years, from the beginning of the 2nd school quarter (end of January) until the end of July.This mobility project is aimed at 87 young people and 12 teachers/technicians from a school population of 1865 students who attend all schools which are part of the Consortium. These students will be direct participants and attend courses from differente areas, such as: Computer science; Electricity and Energy; Administration and Management; Chemistry; Tourism and Hospitality; Chemistry, Health and Multimedia.Students and recent vocational school graduates reside mostly in the North Interior Pinhal region. The beneficiaries of this project are young people between the ages of 16 and 21. There are also about 26 teachers, technicians and managers who will participate in this internship project.This project will provide many short and long-term benefits that will be advantageous to the young beneficiaries\u2019 level of training and qualifications.  This experience will provide them with more opportunities and enhance their regional employability. In regards to our school, this project will help us improve our organization skills and work methods.  It will also help us integrate models and processes in our practices, thus promoting quality and good results.The region will benefit from the qualifications of human resources and its experience in these projects.

The first turn will attend the internship Nov. 6- 26, 2016; the second turn from June 25 to July 15, 2017. During their internship the beneficiaries will carry out the following tasks:- assisting the reception of goods, putting price labels, preparing and displaying them in the shop floor- working at the electronic cash register- assisting customers- finding out structures and activities of charity shops in the UK- realizing the environmental impact of using second-hand goods- recognizing the financial viability of the charity sector- meeting volunteers during placements, and learning about the impact of volunteering- learning about indoor and outdoor activities connected to stately homes- organising and guiding optional programs- participates in orginising eventsThe close guidance allows  trainees to carry out a comparative analysis of employment conditions and recognize the opportunities of starting a charity shop later in Hungary. They'll be aware of the role of touristic establishments in promoting economic growth and explore the opportunities inhering in the utilisation of manor houses for tourism. They can find out the activities and strategies of social enterprises involved in the process, the models of work, the working and social conditions of the people in the host country. They can realize that they are able to meet the demands of the European labour market, and they can be more conscious of their values. They can make a substantial progress in their English knowledge and take an exam soon.Schedule:- Aug 2016: selection of project members, distribution of tasks and obligations, concluding agreements with the partner - Sep 2016: selection and concluding agreements with participants of the first turn- Oct 2016: preparatory course for the first turn, travel arrangements- Nov 2016: mobility period, placements for the first turn and monitoring - Dec 2016: evaluation of the training for the first turn, preparing Europass Mobility Certificates- Nov-Dec 2016: continuous dissemination of results in the school, local and professional communities- Feb-March 2017: selection of participants and concluding agreements with the second turn- May-June 2017: preparatory course for the second turn, travel arrangements- June-July 2017: mobility period, placements for the second turn and monitoring- Aug 2017: evaluation, preparing Europass Mobility Certificates, final reports and closing the project- Sep-Nov 2017: continuous dissemination of resultsImpacts:- the successful ending of the vocational training, favourable involvement in the labour market on the short term and successful carrier as an employee or an entrepreneur on the long term for the participants- widening the frames of the training, involving new contents in our pedagogical program on the short term and making the vocational training attractive for potential partners on the long term for our institution.", "http://www.almondvoclink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-HU01-KA102-022690_1"], ["4BB", "CNC oktat\u00e1s brit sztenderdek szerint", "Almond Vocational Link Ltd", 13739.0, "Two institutions take part in the project \u201cCNC training after British standards\".The NCT Academy Non-profit Organisation trains CNC technicians, CAD/CAM CNC programming technicians, PLC programming technicians and also does industrial trainings.

The project comes out of significant needs of school, which are met by its implementation.The offer of educational programmes at our school has nearly doubled over the past few years and the number of students has increased to the current 880. To meet the educational needs of our students, we extended the number of cooperating organizations in this project up to the current 9 and we have fully covered all the educational programmes taught at our school with mobilities. Apart from several school educational programmes under Applied Chemistry there are some other programmes such as Fire Protection, Security and Legal Studies, Cosmetic Services and apprenticeship Hairdresser. We plan mobilities into six European countries (Germany, Cyprus, Great Britain, Spain, Italy, Slovakia 4x). Our project partners are vocational schools, technical colleges and businesses. With four of our partners we realize reciprocal mobilities.The receiving organizations for students in chemical branches are vocational schools (SBG Dresden, IIS Scalcerle Padova, SOS Chemical Bratislava), two technical colleges (University of Plymouth and the University of Nicosia) and a Spanish pharmaceutical company BIOT Microgen, mediated by Europroyectos LdV Granada.Students in the branch of Fire Protection will participate in an internship at The Secondary School of Construction in \u017dilina, which disposes of excellent technical background in the fire fighting equipment and works closely with the Secondary School of Fire Protection, which will also partake in our students training.Students in the field of Security and Legal Studies pass their practice at the Faculty of Safety Engineering University of \u017dilina, namely the Department of Safety Engineering and the Department of Emergency Engineering.For students of Cosmetic Services and Hairdresser we secured professional experience in beauty and hairdressing salons at Secondary Vocational School (Beauty and Care School).Simultaneously with the increase in number of mobilities, we also strive to raise up the quality. In all mobilities of this project, we will apply the principles of ECVET. Some units of learning outcomes have been created in previous projects and some new are just being created.Within this project we also plan mobilities of pedagogical staff - VET teachers as we believe that professional development of teachers is a prerequisite for quality assurance in education. Besides professional and pedagogical skills of teachers we also want to strengthen their language skills. In this project we want to focus on vocational teachers in the field of Security and Legal Studies who will complete work-programme at the Faculty of Safety Engineering, and vocational teachers in Applied Chemistry who will complete training programme at IIS Scalcerle in Padua.On the side of students we see the impact of the project in the acquisition of new knowledge and skills, strengthening linguistic communication and lexical skills, improving self-confidence and also motivation for further education. Thanks to this experience students gain an overview of the requirements imposed on their profession, learn about possibilities of study abroad and employment on the European labor market.  Through this experience the profile of graduates has been improved, which brings benefit to strategic partners of our school (employers, tertiary education).On the side of school, we see an apparent increase in the attractiveness of school resulting in an increased interest of studying science. Through mobilities the school receives valuable feedback about the quality of education. The school benefits from the exchange of experience and the transfer of good practice in the practice of school. Within this project we above all want to test the units of learning outcomes and start using them for national mobilities afterwards as well.The project will be disseminated through the school website, the educational portal of the Pardubice region authority, local and regional press.

Le B\u00e9al offers them an experience of life sharing with people with disabilities. Over the years, through their new and creative outlook, the volunteers have co-constructed the project of Le B\u00e9al.Profile of participants: We will recruit 5 volunteers who expressed their motivation for sharing life with people with disabilities and for living in a rural area.  Description of the activities:The principal mission given to volunteers is to share the lives of people with disabilities (residents). Alongside these, the volunteers contribute, via the larger purpose of the institution, to the protection of the environment (workshops related to organic farming) and to the development of activities in the cultural and artistic realm as well as sports.Methodology for conducting the project / support:Each volunteer is part of a team of four employees (educators) and a second volunteer. Volunteers participate in regular activities in the workshops (garden, farm, herb workshop, cooking), alongside the workshop master, residents and other volunteers. They are always under the responsibility of an employee.Each volunteer is accompanied by a tutor with whom he meets twice a month for one hour. It is a privileged moment that aims to provide an update of the volunteer\u2019s situation in relation to his mission and his future projects.For at least one month (longer if necessary) the volunteers benefit from enhanced support a weekly one hour meeting with the tutor and three hours of group training. The purpose of this introduction is to acquire the necessary expertise to be in relationship with people with disabilities and to discover all aspects of his mission in reference to the French context and the particular context of Le B\u00e9al. The volunteers learn as they go along and acquire the skills necessary in the various areas of the project always accompanied by experienced people.Impact for volunteers: The nature of the project promotes the acquisition of:- Skills in the areas of human competences (how to be and how to do); it is mainly human relations that volunteers will create with all the people in the project- Skills in the fields of the different workshops (farm, garden, herb workshop, cooking)Impact for residents and employees of the institution:- Openness to cultural and generational difference.

Hyria was established in August 2009 by merging seven vocational education institutions and adult education centres. Hyria operates in the rapidly growing Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Riihim\u00e4ki region which has nearly 90 000 residents, 34 000 jobs, and 5000 companies of which many operate internationally.  The development of international operations is very important to Hyria and therefore internationalisation is one of the focus points in its strategy and operations. Student and staff mobility have been identified as critical success factors in reaching the objectives set for international activities.  The aim is to increase our students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 professional and international skills by offering them a possibility to participate in the international mobility programs. By enabling our students and teachers to acquire new skills and knowledge the quality of education increases as well as student\u2019s employment opportunities. At the same time, Hyria serves the needs of the area\u2019s working life by producing a highly skilled workforce.  Objectives and expected resultsThe most important objective is to increase the students\u2019 professional skills, knowledge and attitudes by emphasizing the acquisition and development of key competencies of lifelong learning. The exchange period comprehensively enables students to develop the key competencies which are needed for personal fulfilment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. During the exchange period students encounter new situations; they apply already gained knowledge and language skills in practice; learn to use new technological solutions and platforms while communicating with their teachers, friends and family in the home country; and they compare working methods, the acquisition of technical solutions, the level of sustainable development and legislative issues in the host country. In addition, students are able to develop international and personal capabilities such as cultural awareness, language skills, interpersonal skills, individual growth, independence and the ability to work in a multicultural environment. For teachers the project activities give a possibility to update their professional knowledge and understanding of current requirements of a working life.  With the help of this experience the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 professional identity gets stronger, and they are able to find out more field-specific professional development possibilities. It enriches the education in many ways, as well as encourages students\u2019 to entrepreneurship and language learning. The second objective is to continue the development of international activities at Hyria. This time the development activities are focused on the following issues: - Shifting from short-term co-operation agreements to long-term ones (MOU, LOI)- Creating a centralized mobility process, instructions and orientation to teachers and staff members. - Formalise a model and a structure of an international study path for Hyria\u2019s students. MobilityThis application comprises 42 student mobility covering 25 different vocational qualifications. Principally exchange periods are offered to Hyria\u2019s second or third year students (young), but also to adult students and recent graduates can participate. In 2017 there will be 5 students from fewer backgrounds (economical) selected and granted an additional support for living and cultural expenses.Teacher and staff mobility (20 persons) is connected to work life periods, visiting new partners in Sweden, Italy, Portugal and Poland, and visiting Norway to learn more about revolution of the automobile sector. In the future the majority of cars are assumed to be electric ones, and this change will have an effect on an operation of garages. In Norway every fifth new car is and electric car already now.

D.I.C.K. was born after a careful analysis of the needs expressed by the members of the partnership and the examination of potential economic growth that Calabria territory could enable through a better training of its human resources and a better  marketing action for the positioning of food products in international market.\r\nThe Calabria region ( especially the territories  represented by the municipalities that are project partners) is characterized by an important agricultural and touristic potential. These territories despite their cultural and natural heritage, and the development of enogastronomic sector have been experiencing high rates of unemployment .\r\nThe region and the province of Reggio Calabria are not sufficiently able to enhance and promote their products. The high quality of products is not enough for the development if a marketing strategy is not implemented and  human resources are not really qualified.\r\nStarting from these considerations, MOB.Y. DICK was born to train adequate resources who can help face the challenges and opportunities coming from the global market and bring attention on agricultural and agri-food enterprises management. The objectives of the project are:\r\n1.To encourage a greater awareness of the opportunities that food industry can represent for territorial development;\r\n2.To train human resources able to answer global market modern needs;\r\n3.To work for a gradual and progressive adjustment of training systems according the real business needs, starting from the international experience and taking into account the European ECVET system of skills certification;\r\n4.To learn, through cooperation with foreign partners, good practices in the field of business management and marketing;\r\n5.To stimulate a greater dialogue among all stakeholders involved in the field of agribusiness and territorial development.\r\n\r\nMOB.Y.

Coming in contact with foreign companies and with different working styles, they will have the possibility to internationalize their curriculum and to acquire  knowledge for entering the European labor market . Their curriculum will be enriched by the Europass Mobility and other foreign certifications. Locally, the project will be an important opportunity for a territory that is characterized by an high level of youth unemployment. For recent graduates, it will represent an opportunity to apply the knowledge they learnt at school in a real labor experience functional to their career development.\r\nMoreover, the cooperation among various stakeholders involved in the area, will create greater synergy in order to join efforts in the promotion and commercialization of food and agriculture products. The comparison with the learners, once they get back, will represent a unique opportunity to compare different practices and to learn how foreign companies and territories have worked for the promotion of their own brands.\r\nMOB.Y.

The network has carried out several LDV and LDV-Vetpro projects since 2002. The present project is coordinated by the Federation of Education in Central Ostrobothnia, Kpedu.\r\nThe goal of the FRESH2 project is to further conform and develop the shared practices of the network colleges, the supervision of students taking part in mobility periods, the quality of student mobility periods and the use of the ECVET system.  The goal is to increase the number of mobility periods, to make use of the skills and the knowhow acquired abroad, and to increase the transparency of the degrees. The goal is to support the on-the-job learning periods of the students through uniform methods as well as to guide the workplace instructors to help students acquire professional skills. A central issue is to make the workplace instructors in the foreign countries actively participate in the supervision of the students and to emphasize the working life as an essential learning environment, as well as work-based learning. We make use of the eTaitava online tool with the help of which the student reflects upon the acquisition of professional skills during the on-the-job learning periods. With the help of eTaitava application the teacher in the sending country obtains systematical information about the student\u2019s learning progress. In this project, the use of eTaitava is expanded to apply to workplace instructors in the partner countries, as well. They will be provided with English-language questions pertaining to the student\u2019s orientation, safety at work, working life skills, learning and hidden knowledge (for example perseverance, curiosity, language and cultural competence). With the help of the instructors\u2019 replies to eTaitava questions, both the student and the teacher in the sending country obtain real-time feedback about the student\u2019s mobility period. Using the MOOC learning portal, the eTaitava questions are presented to both students and working life.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this project both students and staff from the participating colleges will be participating in the exchange periods. In turn, we will invite two working-life representatives from abroad to visit in Finland. The participating students are students of practical nursing, hairdressing, beauty care, and youth work. The partner countries are Estonia, Italy, Spain, Malta, Greece, Slovenia, Germany, Belgium, the UK and Sweden.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exchange periods abroad have been agreed on with the partner colleges abroad using Memorandums of Understanding, and with other types of partners using Letters of Intent. The mobility periods will commence in the autumn of 2017 through staff mobility periods. The purpose is to carry out all staff mobility periods before the student mobility periods take place. The staff will travel as teams of 2-4 people, with members of the various network colleges comprising each team. The goal of the staff mobility periods is to find out in a concrete way about the possibilities and work practices offered by each on-the-job training place and to develop the supervision practices in the on-the-job learning periods both abroad and in the home country.\r\n\r\nThe student mobility periods will be carried out after the staff mobility periods. In the student mobility periods, individuality and flexibility are emphasized in all stages, starting with the learning agreements.\r\nThe project makes it possible to develop a close cooperation between the colleges and the working life. As the result of the project, we conform the practices used in our national network, export good and functional practices abroad and develop the supervision of on-the-job learning periods in the home country based on the good practices obtained abroad. We also develop the eTaitava online guidance portal to support on-the-job learning taking place abroad.  We can share the knowledge obtained from the use of the eTaitava application after the project both in the home country and abroad in future projects. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith the help of the project, we produce professionals who can answer more effectively to the needs of the working life around Finland, and we educate qualified personnel both in the colleges and in working life who will form national and international networks during the mobility periods.

In the whole, ten groups of students and two groups of teachers will travel abroad for an internship.The increasing number of foreign mobilities and the strengthening of an international cooperation are the basic objectives of the strategic development plan of our school.\r\nThe offer of the study programmes at our school has nearly doubled over the past few years and the number of students has increased up to the current 957. \r\nIn addition to the traditional field of study Applied Chemistry being taught in several specializations, there are some new study programmes such as Fire Protection, Security and Legal Studies, or study programme Hairdresser and Beauty Services. To meet the educational needs of our students and allow them to travel to a foreign mobility within their study focus, we expanded our circle of cooperating organizations on the current nine and now we have fully covered all the educational programmes taught at our school with mobilities.

Besides professional and pedagogical skills of teachers we also want to strengthen their language skills. In this project we want to focus on vocational teachers in the field of Security and Legal Studies who will complete work-programme at the Faculty of Security Engineering, and further on teachers in the field of Applied Chemistry who will participate in a working program at ITT Buonarroti-Pozzo in Trento focused on the use of information technology in teaching and learning. On the side of students we see the impact of the project in the acquisition of new knowledge and skills, strengthening linguistic communication and lexical knowledge, improving self-confidence and also motivation for further education. Thanks to this experience students gain an overview of the demands put on their profession, learn about possibilities of study abroad and employment at the European labor market. Through this experience the profile of graduates has been improved, which brings benefit to strategic partners of our school (employers, tertiary education).\r\nOn the side of school, we see an apparent increase in the attractiveness of school resulting in an increased interest of studying science.

The selection criteria are as follows: reliability, independence, self-initiative, consistency, meeting deadlines, practical class evaluation, willingness to cooperate, communication skills, flexibility and knowledge of English. We think that a comprehensive insight into a student is essential and that excellent school results  are not the most important evaluating principles. We have also included another criterion according to which students from underprivileged families  should be given  precedence. Mobility will take place from February to  April 2018 with the exception of  England which is planned for October 2017 due to the hairdressing event 'Salon International'.\r\nMain activities:\r\n- application deadlines for students interested in mobility projects and student selection (August, September 2017)\r\n- meeting with the accompanying teachers, meeting with parents, students and teachers bound for England (September 2017)\r\n- Mobility England, establish contacts with foreign coordinators regarding the period of time and accommodation (October 2017)\r\n-  preparation camp for students with workshops (October-November 2017)\r\n- meeting with students and their parents (January-March 2018)\r\n- last meeting before the mobility for students, parents and accompanying teachers + ECVET document (depending on when mobility starts)\r\n-  Mobility (February, March, April 2018), students' mobility blog during the mobility\r\n- students' dissemination in class, accompanying teachers' job shadowing report and at the staff meeting (April, May, June 2018)\r\n- evaluation including Mobility tool, ECVET document, students' report, interview with the coordinator and the teachers (depending on the period of time when the mobilities are carried out)\r\n- evaluation of the whole project and partner organizations' feedback (June 2018)\r\nThe expected outcomes are: improved quality of education, highly motivated students and teachers in every field especially in foreign languages learning and getting to know new cultures,  gained competitive advantage, recognition and good reputation which consequently leads to an increased number of students enrolling in our school, established professional and personal contacts, better possibilities of employment for students at home as well as abroad thanks to a bigger flexibility on the job market (EM), acquired knowledge that can be compared to other vocational standards in EU.", "http://www.almondvoclink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SI01-KA102-035420_6"], ["4JB", "Mi\u0119dzynarodowe sta\u017ce zawodowe uczni\u00f3w i nauczycieli Zespo\u0142u Szk\u00f3\u0142 Us\u0142ugowych", "Enso Group", 115599.0, "The project applicant is Zesp\u00f3\u0142 Szk\u00f3\u0142 Us\u0142ugowych (ZSU)  in Ostr\u00f3w Wielkopolski, with Enzo Group from Great Britain,  Handwerkskammer S\u00fcdth\u00fcringen Berufsbildungs und Technologiezentrum Rohr - Kloster from Germany, Enzo Group from the UK and Raahen koulutuskuntayhtym\u00e4 from Finland, as partners.

The student work experience during the course of the project is a part of the school compulsory training period and it will be carried out in small business in British food and hospitality industry as well as vocational training centres in Germany, which will  provide the participants with real experience of the  European work and employment market.International work experience is a novel approach to professional training, as compared to traditional apprenticeship carried out in a student home country.  Furthermore, thanks to the participation in the project the students will improve their professional knowledge and develop their practical skills, which, as a result, will increase their work competiveness. The participants will get a chance to develop their language competencies, with a focus on work related vocabulary, which will help them to pass vocational qualification examination in the future.

During the exchange period students encounter new situations; they apply already gained knowledge and language skills in practice; learn to use new technological solutions and platforms while communicating with their teachers, friends and family in the home country; and they compare working methods, the acquisition of technical solutions, the level of sustainable development and legislative issues in the host country.\r\n \r\nIn addition, students are able to develop international and personal capabilities such as cultural awareness, language skills, interpersonal skills, individual growth, independence and the ability to work in a multicultural environment. For teachers the project activities give a possibility to update their professional knowledge and understanding of current requirements of a working life.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of this experience the students and teachers\u2019 professional identity gets stronger, and they are able to find out more field-specific professional development possibilities. It enriches the education in many ways, as well as encourages students\u2019 to entrepreneurship and language learning. \r\n\r\nThe second objective is to continue the development of international activities at Hyria. In this time the development activities are focused on the following issues: \r\n\r\n- The current development activities are evaluated and established into practise.\r\n- Mobility statistics will be improved.  The estimated numbers are compared with the implemented ones by departments and target groups.  \r\n- Creating a uniform way to mark the exchange period into students\u2019 transcript of records.\r\n- Shifting from short-term co-operation agreements to long-term ones (MOU, LOI).\r\n- Creating a centralized mobility process, instructions and orientation to teachers and staff members. \r\n\r\nMobility\r\n\r\nThis application comprises 70 student mobility covering 25 different vocational qualifications. Principally exchange periods are offered to Hyria\u2019s second or third year students (young), but also to adult students and recent graduates can participate. In 2017-2018 there will be 5 students from fewer backgrounds (economical) selected and granted an additional support for living and cultural expenses.\r\n\r\nThe mobility of staff and world of work (31 persons) is connected to teacher/expert exchanges, work life periods, visiting new partners and work placements for quality reasons.", "http://www.almondvoclink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA116-034380_20"], ["6LT", "Verbesserung der Kenntnisse und Kompetenzen f\u00fcr einen modernen Unterricht im 21.

Accordingly, our graduates are in great demand at home and abroad. In order to be able to offer the pupils not only a special orientation but also a broad education at a high level, we would like to train them in digital, personal, social and linguistic competence and encourage them to learn independently and in a motivated way. We want to offer our students the best possible opportunities to develop their potential and at the same time meet the demands of the European labour market. \r\nIn order to meet these wide-ranging requirements, transnational activities are particularly suitable. As well as the obvious technical content, they always have a very high level of general education and usually also require the use of a foreign language. As a result, the training courses for our teaching staff that where chosen will increase the quality of our school. \r\nIn order to meet the requirements of the 21st century, we have aimed to improve teaching in the areas of language training, methodology and didactics and to make the school even more international. \r\nThrough the increased use of eEducation tools (teaching and learning with new media) and new approaches in language, mathematics and technical IT lessons, we aim to achieve higher quality in our training. Since English as a working language and a means of communication is an essential part of today's working world, it is also an objective that the CLIL teaching and language competence of CLIL and language teachers remain up to date. The contact and exchange of information with schools and institutes from other countries is an enormous enrichment for teachers and learners and must be further developed.\r\nOur ten participants, six of them are general educators, four are specialist engineers, are all convinced of the motto \"lifelong learning\" and are therefore very motivated to constantly improve their teaching. Most of them already teach parts of their lessons in English. The others want to integrate CLIL methodology into their lessons in the future. \r\nThe training courses chosen cover the topics: Use of information and communication technology as a teaching and learning tool, new insights into the methodology of foreign language teaching, creativity and professional communication skills, modern teaching methods for mathematics, teaching programming and robotics, game-based learning as a form of teaching and methods for CLIL lessons. All courses are held in English in a non-German speaking country.\r\nAfter the courses, participants will use their newly acquired knowledge and skills themselves and will also serve as multipliers and people to contact in our school. There will be an increased use of new media and eEducation. The improved language skills will make it easier for participants to teach in English. We assume that this will result in an increased number of CLIL lessons. \r\nSome participants already have plans which international projects they want to carry out in the future and hope to meet colleagues with whom they can implement them. Furthermore, all participants will make contacts in order to exchange knowledge and ideas for other international collaborations and projects. \r\nIn the long term, it is important to us that the participants motivate other teachers and pupils to take part in international further education or work placements abroad, because looking beyond the borders is essential for a modern, well-trained person in the 21st century.", "http://www.amber-initiatives.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-AT01-KA101-039070_3"], ["4BB", "Einblicke in die kaufm\u00e4nnische Berufswelt in Gro\u00dfbritannien, Frankreich und Spanien und deren Vorbereitung.", "Almond Vocational Link Ltd", 83395.0, "As the  participants are trainees at a vocational school it is very important to provide practical training in order to prepare them for a professional career.

While thousands of refugees/immigrants flow into Europe, the extremism rises even to the extent of using terrorist violence against fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nYoung people become an easy victim of these behaviors. Lacking their own critical thinking and inner motivation for being active citizens, they indulge into manipulations and threads starting from violent behaviors in school. School crime, bullying and violence are major concerns and pose an increasing challenge for the European Union authorities. School bullying is a nowadays a widespread phenomenon which takes many forms, such as discriminatory bullying against minority groups, homophobic bullying and bullying against students with special needs. It can also concern any other students who seem vulnerable for or different from their peers.\r\n\r\nIn this context, there is a need to strengthen the common European values of freedom, tolerance, respect for diversity and non-discrimination. The 2015 Paris Declaration on promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education comes to light the way to deal with them: education. Knowing though, that school system is overloaded with strict curriculum goals, out of school learning (Non-Formal Learning) can play a key role in this! Youth work can have a significant impact in cultivating critical thinking and fundamental values among young people, preventing extremism, violence and radicalization. In fact, the Youth Work Report 2014 has identified that youth work can result in a range of positive effects for youth which enable them to enhance competences, reinforce their network and social capital, improve particular behaviors and develop positive relationships. Given this, we want to develop this project in order for youth workers of today to acquire additional competences and methods that prevent the violent radicalization of young people, especially among to the hard to reach young people (minorities, migrants etc.).\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is thus to develop the competences of youth workers for preventing violent radicalization of young people, particularly to the hard to reach young people \r\nIts objectives are: \r\n\u2022\tTo develop understanding about the common reality all over Europe regarding violent radicalization\r\n\u2022\tTo raise awareness about the reasons for radicalization happens among young people in different parts of society\r\n\u2022\tTo increase the knowledge/awareness of youth workers regarding what young people need to develop fundamental values.\r\n\u2022\tTo develop skills to prevent violence and radicalization of young people, particularly to the hard to reach youth.\r\n\u2022\tTo equip with innovative methods and tools for working with hard to reach young people\r\n\u2022\tTo increase the fundamental values on youth workers themselves and motivate them to work for strengthening these values with their target groups\r\n\u2022\tTo develop follow-up activities targeting hard to reach young people\r\n\r\nThis project supports the professional development of youth workers and significantly improves the level of their key competences. Using methods from non-formal and experiential learning and innovative concepts in youth work, it aims at achieving a better future society, infused by human rights respect, active citizenship, intercultural dialogue, social inclusion and solidarity. In the end of the project, youth workers will have improved competences and better quality in their work and activities in favor of young people.\r\n\r\nBuild Inner Peace - Bring Outer Peace project has one activity - a learning mobility of youth workers from the Programme countries. 31 people will participate in this mobility, 27 of which will be participants (learners), 3 will form the trainer\u2019s team and 1 person will be administrative and logistic support. The training will take place from 06 - 14 November 2018, at the educational center \"School in the Nature\", Gudevica village near the town of Smolyan in the Rhodope Mountains. The main activity in the project is a training course for Youth workers. The TC will contain of 7 full training days. The participants will be from 9 countries \u2013 Bulgaria, Romania, Cyprus, UK, Italy, France, Greece, Hungary and Estonia.\r\n\r\nThere are four competence areas that the learners (Youth workers) will develop through this project:\r\n1.\tAddressing the topic of violent radicalization\r\n2.\tDelivering workshops/activities against radicalization\r\n3.\tWorking with hard to reach target groups (NEET, youth with fewer opportunities, refugees, and migrants)\r\n4.\tPerforming high quality youth work based on professional expertise", "http://www.amber-initiatives.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-BG01-KA105-047569_2"], ["4BB", "2015-1-FI01-KA109-009213", "Almond Vocational Link Ltd", 135031.0, "Background\r\n \r\nHyria Education (Hyria) is a multidisciplinary educational institution offering vocational education and training. Hyria operates in the rapidly growing Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Riihim\u00e4ki region which has nearly 90 000 residents, 34 000 jobs, and 5000 companies of which many operate internationally. \r\n \r\nThe development of international operations is very important to Hyria and therefore internationalisation was one of the focus points in its strategy and operations for the period of 2011-2017. In a new strategy internationalisation is not mentioned as a focus point, but it takes in the account of changing needs of workers\u2019 skills and competence due to the e.g. digitalisation, urbanisation, climate change and globalisation. Hyria strategy is not set for the specific timeframe, but it can be modified if necessary due to fast change of the operational environment.\r\n\r\nInternational activities at Hyria are aiming to increase our students, teachers and work life partners\u2019 professional and international skills by offering them a possibility to participate in the international mobility programs. By enabling our students and teachers to acquire new skills and knowledge the quality of education increases as well as student\u2019s employment opportunities. At the same time, Hyria fosters the co-operation with the world of work and serves the needs of the area\u2019s working life by producing a highly skilled workforce. \r\n\r\nObjectives and expected results\r\n\r\nThe most important objective is to increase the students\u2019 professional skills, knowledge and attitudes by emphasizing the acquisition and development of key competencies of lifelong learning.\r\n \r\nThe exchange period comprehensively enables students to develop the key competencies which are needed for personal fulfilment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. During the exchange period students encounter new situations; they apply already gained knowledge and language skills in practice; learn to use new technological solutions and platforms while communicating with their teachers, friends and family in the home country; and they compare working methods, the acquisition of technical solutions, the level of sustainable development and legislative issues in the host country.\r\n \r\nIn addition, students are able to develop international and personal capabilities such as cultural awareness, language skills, interpersonal skills, individual growth, independence and the ability to work in a multicultural environment. For teachers the project activities give a possibility to update their professional knowledge and understanding of current requirements of a working life.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of this experience the students and teachers\u2019 professional identity gets stronger, and they are able to find out more field-specific professional development possibilities. It enriches the education in many ways, as well as encourages students\u2019 to entrepreneurship and language learning. \r\n\r\nThe second objective is to continue the development of international activities at Hyria. In this time the development activities are focused on the following issues: \r\n\r\n- The evaluation system of international activities will be improved. \r\n- Mobility statistics will be improved. The implemented periods are compared with the estimated ones by departments and target groups.  \r\n- The organisation of international activities at Hyria (better involvement of adult learners).\r\n- Inclusion of international activities into implementation plans of the new curricula.\r\n- Developing an international learning pathway for students.\r\n- Shifting from short-term co-operation agreements to long-term ones (MOU, LOI).\r\n- Creating a centralized mobility process, instructions and orientation to teachers and staff members. \r\n- Updating the programme for international activities. \r\n\r\nAs a result of these activities the mobility periods are implemented according the ECVET procedures, the procedures of international activities are improved, internationalisation at home is expanded, internationalisation is spread into the different departments and students. In addition to that, the transparency of student guidance is improved (blogs as learning diaries) and we have a stronger cooperation with companies. \r\n\r\nMobility\r\n\r\nThis application comprises 61 student mobility periods covering 25 different vocational qualifications. Exchange periods are offered to Hyria\u2019s second or third year students (young), but also to adult students and recent graduates can participate. 5 selected students will receive additional monetary support (exceptional costs) for living and cultural expenses due to the fewer opportunities (economical). \r\n\r\nThe mobility of staff and world of work (22 persons) is connected to teacher/expert exchanges, visiting new partners and work placements for quality reasons. There will be also 4 people invited to teach and guide Hyria\u2019s students of the health care sector.", "http://www.almondvoclink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA116-046772_7"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4EE", "ENVIRONMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE ASSOCIATES LIMITED*", 8025.0, "Legal advice, litigation and infringements \u2014 Legal expenses (25.01.08)", "fts_2017_14591", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "PL3"}
