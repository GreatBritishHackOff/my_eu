Jobs in the business sector, in tourism, in health and leisure management as well as in cultural institutions, in correspondence with the principles of our type of school, increasingly require them to be competent speakers of several foreign languages and perform appropriately in intercultural settings. At the same time, we are experiencing a shift towards more heterogeneous classes, also with regard to ethnic and geographic origins of our students, which, of course, entails challenges of its own.\r\nThus, teaching staff participating in this project will acquire knowledge and skills that will enable them to work with heterogeneous groups and classes in a way that is both competent and equally beneficial for all members. In addition, innovative teaching methods founded in an overall approach that considers \u2018diversity as opportunity\u2018 will guarantee that \u2018employability, active citizenship and entrepreneurship\u2018, the guiding principles of vocational schools, will receive adequate attention. Our school\u2019s headmistress and administrative staff, in exchange with best practice institutions, will develop visions and tools that will adapt the framework of learning and teaching as well as the general orientation of our school to meet the requirements of increasingly heterogeneous and international classrooms.\r\n34 staff members working across all levels and departments will take part in the project: from senior to middle management, from the quality assurance representative and careers advisors  to teaching staff. The latter have been selected to cover all fields of studies offered at our school: foreign languages, business, sciences, mathematics as well as food and service and physical education.\r\nThe activities planned range from visiting best practice schools, with the objective of exchanging experiences and acquiring some tried and tested strategies and methods to deal with diversity, to attending fairs and congresses relevant to our project as well as taking part in teacher training courses lasting up to a week and focusing on the topics of diversity, heterogeneity and equal opportunities.\r\nThe selection of participants according to the above-mentioned criteria will ensure that the knowledge and skills acquired will be disseminated among both the manegerial and teaching staff of our school, which is expected to result in a prompt and comprehensive enhancement of the quality of teaching and learning in accordance with our project proposal \u2018Learning together \u2013 Diversity as Opportunity\u2018. Specific preparation for and systematic analysis of the individual activities will optimise the implementation of new strategies and methods.\r\nThe overall objective of the project is to systematically use the expected increase in experiences and competences to further enhance the quality of our school. A heightened awareness of the challenges brought about by the growing social, linguistic and cultural diversity, an open and tolerant attitude towards others as well as teaching methods that meet the specific needs of heterogeneous classes are the learning outcomes we want to see reflected in everyday school life. As a consequence, students will also acquire intercultural sensibility and skills, which means the central educational objectives of vocational schools, employability, active citizenship and entrepreneurship, will be met more fully. \r\nIn the long term we are aiming to expand our international network by adding both cultural and educational institutions to our already existing list of partners. Finally, we also hope to receive additional impulses to further develop our school to live up to the political and social reality of the 21st century.", "http://www.amber-initiatives.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA101-034861_9"], ["6LT", "GEMS ( Goal-based Educational Movement to Success)", "Amber  Initiatives", 42488.0, "The rational of the GEMS ( Goal-based Educational Movement to Success) comes from the utter need to combat the dramatically increasing the students absence and modernize and internationalize our institution.

Furthermore it has a strong international vocation  and a constant research in the field of new educational methodologies. For this reason we need a constant training of our teachers, especially in the field of languages and methodological training aiming at a multicultural and inclusive teaching.\r\nOBJECTIVES: In our three years Educational Offer Plan (2016-2019) we have stated the following srategic improvement purposes:\r\n- To reduce the percentage of students who fail their first two years of High School, to dicrease the rate of school unsuccess and the drop out of school;\r\n- To dicrease the school unsuccess of foreign students and to foster inclusive behaviours for all students who have learning difficulties;\r\n- To improve language competences of the students by mean of a constant specific training addressed to teachers of Not Linguistic Subjects (NLS), aiming at increasing their competences in the CLIL field.\r\nACTIVITIES:The foreseen training lasts for two years and involves the following areas:\r\nImprovement of the knowledge of foreign languages and fostering of CLIL methodologies:\r\n- Full immersion courses in English in Dublin and  in French in Cannes;\r\n- CLIL course and English for teachers in Dublin;\r\nTraining on teaching methodologies and strategies in order to promote inclusion:\r\n- One week visit to schools located in Finland and Sweden;\r\n-One week training courses on inclusion and multiculturality held in Barcelona, Cannes and 10 days course in Plymouth\r\nNUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS:12\r\nPROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS: theachers skilled in the field of the project's topic with a basic linguistic knowledge, willing to make a new experience abroad and to share the results of their training through updating activites for collegues and through the creation of innovative educational methodologies.\r\nMETHODOLOGY TO BE USED IN CARRYING OUT THE PROJECT\r\nThe courses we have chosen have been agreed on with partners whith a deep experience in the field of reference, in educational training and in the participation into European projects in order to sort the most efficient activities for our needs and to distribute them within a lap of two years. The school and in particular the commission which will follow the project, will take care of each step of it, from the training of participants, to the monitoring during the courses attendence and eventually when people will come back, when theachers will commit themselves to share the results obtained and to implement new methodologies for improving the inclusion of foreign students. The results achieved will be monitored through questionnaires and statistical enquiries.

How are students taken care of and coached? How can the experiences made be included into the daily life at school and at work? How are the mobilities going to be evaluated and deliberated?

All possess good professional and personal skills and have already shown interest in projects of this kind. Here in Germany they are going to be prepared profoundly within the areas of self-awareness, cultural knowledge, professional skills and language and communication competencies. They learn, in collaboration with the foreign partner institutions and enterprises, to independently live and work in a foreign country and are going to acquire personal and professional skills and faculties as well as new language knowledge.   The project is going to be executed in close collaboration and coordination of all involved parties (apprentices, their employers, foreign partner institutions and cooperating enterprises as well as our school). For the exchange of information, especially for the communication with our foreign partners, modern communication devices and platforms such as Etwinnings are going to be used. A special focus is on avoiding disadvantages of any kind for the involved parties. Everybody will benefit by this project and all requirements of the concerned institutions and individuals will be taken into consideration. This includes aspects such as insurances, boarding and accommodation as well as travelling. All these points have already been thought about and are organized or prepared. Partnership mandates or a Memorandum of Understanding is going to be agreed on and signed by all partners. This obligates all institutes to do everything they can to organize, execute and evaluate this project. By the usage of Etwinnings and Email communication is going to be institutionalized so that a permanent exchange about the development of the trainees is secured. The process is going to be monitored permanently and evaluated at the end. This will mainly happen by the students\u2019 reports, questionnaires and SWOT analyses. During the placements, contact will be held by Etwinnings but also email and telephone are possible means of communication to be able to act quickly and be able to react spontaneously in cases of emergencies.  Extremely important for the success of a mobility is its preparation. These are going to be mainly proceeded by the employees of the vocational school in Oldenburg. The short-, middle- and long-term results are going to be most fundamental for the trainees concerned.

The goal is to increase the number of mobility periods, to make use of the skills and the knowhow acquired abroad, and to increase the transparency of the degrees. The goal is to support the on-the-job learning periods of the students through uniform methods as well as to guide the workplace instructors to help students acquire professional skills. A central issue is to make the workplace instructors in the foreign countries actively participate in the supervision of the students and to emphasize the working life as an essential learning environment, as well as work-based learning.

In this project, the use of eTaitava is expanded to apply to workplace instructors in the partner countries, as well. They will be provided with English-language questions pertaining to the student\u2019s orientation, safety at work, working life skills, learning and hidden knowledge (for example perseverance, curiosity, language and cultural competence). With the help of the instructors\u2019 replies to eTaitava questions, both the student and the teacher in the sending country obtain real-time feedback about the student\u2019s mobility period. Using the MOOC learning portal, the eTaitava questions are presented to both students and working life.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this project both students and staff from the participating colleges will be participating in the exchange periods.

The mobility periods will commence in the autumn of 2017 through staff mobility periods. The purpose is to carry out all staff mobility periods before the student mobility periods take place. The staff will travel as teams of 2-4 people, with members of the various network colleges comprising each team. The goal of the staff mobility periods is to find out in a concrete way about the possibilities and work practices offered by each on-the-job training place and to develop the supervision practices in the on-the-job learning periods both abroad and in the home country.\r\n\r\nThe student mobility periods will be carried out after the staff mobility periods. In the student mobility periods, individuality and flexibility are emphasized in all stages, starting with the learning agreements.\r\nThe project makes it possible to develop a close cooperation between the colleges and the working life. As the result of the project, we conform the practices used in our national network, export good and functional practices abroad and develop the supervision of on-the-job learning periods in the home country based on the good practices obtained abroad. We also develop the eTaitava online guidance portal to support on-the-job learning taking place abroad.  We can share the knowledge obtained from the use of the eTaitava application after the project both in the home country and abroad in future projects. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith the help of the project, we produce professionals who can answer more effectively to the needs of the working life around Finland, and we educate qualified personnel both in the colleges and in working life who will form national and international networks during the mobility periods. The personnel that has participated in mobility periods understands the significance of the on-the-job learning periods as part of the qualification and they are able to recognize the skills and the knowhow acquired by the students during their mobility periods.", "http://www.almondvoclink.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA102-034525_5"], ["4BB", "VET learners and staff mobilities 2017", "Almond Vocational Link Ltd", 91045.0, "This project builds on a previous nine-year\u00b4experience with mobility programmes at our school, thanks to which our students and VET teachers can gain priceless both personal and professional experience by completing a short-term study programme at the workplaces of our foreign partners. \r\nWithin this project, we plan to realize 56 mobilities, out of which 50 are intended for students and 6 for teachers. In the whole, ten groups of students and two groups of teachers will travel abroad for an internship.The increasing number of foreign mobilities and the strengthening of an international cooperation are the basic objectives of the strategic development plan of our school.\r\nThe offer of the study programmes at our school has nearly doubled over the past few years and the number of students has increased up to the current 957. \r\nIn addition to the traditional field of study Applied Chemistry being taught in several specializations, there are some new study programmes such as Fire Protection, Security and Legal Studies, or study programme Hairdresser and Beauty Services. To meet the educational needs of our students and allow them to travel to a foreign mobility within their study focus, we expanded our circle of cooperating organizations on the current nine and now we have fully covered all the educational programmes taught at our school with mobilities. We plan to send participants in six European countries (Germany, Cyprus, Great Britain, Spain, Italy, Slovakia 4x). Among our project partners there are six upper secondary technical schools, three universities and one educational center. With four of our project partners we will implement reciprocal mobilities.\r\nThe hosting organizations of our Chemistry students will be schools SBG Dresden, Vocational Chemical School in Bratislava, IIS P. Scalcerle in Padua, two universities - the University of Plymouth and the University of Nicosia and a Spanish training centre in Cartagena. Students in the branch of study Fire Protection will participate in an internship at Vocational School of Fire Protection in \u017dilina (Slovakia). Students in Security and Legal Studies will pass their practice at the Faculty of Security Engineering of the University of \u017dilina, specifically at the Department of Crisis and Security Management. Another group of these students will complete a course on forensic analysis at Vocational Chemical School in Bratislava. For students in the branch Beauty Services and Hairdresser there is ensured professional experience in beauty and hairdressing salons at Vocational school specialized in hairdressing and making visage in Bratislava. Simultaneously with the increase in number of mobilities, we also strive to raise up the quality of the project. In all mobilities of this project, we will apply the principles of ECVET system and will be testing units of learning outcomes. We will also deal with the procedure of participants assessment. Within this project we also plan mobilities of pedagogical staff - VET teachers as we believe that professional development of teachers is a prerequisite for quality assurance in education. Besides professional and pedagogical skills of teachers we also want to strengthen their language skills. In this project we want to focus on vocational teachers in the field of Security and Legal Studies who will complete work-programme at the Faculty of Security Engineering, and further on teachers in the field of Applied Chemistry who will participate in a working program at ITT Buonarroti-Pozzo in Trento focused on the use of information technology in teaching and learning. On the side of students we see the impact of the project in the acquisition of new knowledge and skills, strengthening linguistic communication and lexical knowledge, improving self-confidence and also motivation for further education. Thanks to this experience students gain an overview of the demands put on their profession, learn about possibilities of study abroad and employment at the European labor market. Through this experience the profile of graduates has been improved, which brings benefit to strategic partners of our school (employers, tertiary education).\r\nOn the side of school, we see an apparent increase in the attractiveness of school resulting in an increased interest of studying science. Through mobilities the school receives valuable feedback about the quality of education. The school benefits from the exchange of experience and the transfer of good practice in the practice of school. Within this project we above all want to test the units of learning outcomes and start using them for national mobilities afterwards as well.\r\nThe project will be disseminated through the school website, the educational portal of the Pardubice region authority, local and regional press.

They use an internet-based system for monitoring and evaluating of the students.\r\nYou can find Hotel Kastiel in the area of Slovakia mostly lived by Hungarians works as a training hotel for students. Besides it gives training possibilities for 4 students in 2 terms, it provides different basic trainings and catering retrainings as well. Our students can spend 2 months in this hotel in the summer of 2018.\r\nIn the UK, 5 of our students can spend 2 months in Plymouth due to our partner.\r\nOur students are helped by mentor teachers (totally 8) in conformity and making contacts at the beginning of the trainings. Moreover, if it is possible we try to escort the students during the onward and backward journey, too. In Germany and Slovakia there are mentoring processes during the training period done by our school teachers.\r\nBefore the training abroad we organize prep trainings for the students in language, cooking, pastry-cooking and serving. The aim of the trainings is learning about the theoretical and practical knowledge of gastronomy. During the prep training psychologist and mental hygiene specialist attend to the students whose purposes are team-building, improving communicational skills and handling conflicts, international workexperience, dangers of being abroad, homesickness and being far away from their family.\r\nIn the course of a parent meeting we involve parents into the organizational process and inform them about the training program, the budget, the contracting - and reporting duties.\r\nThe prep trainings and the working processes are created based on the valid vocational exam requirements and the offers of the national curriculum module by module to assure the exact preparatory process and to agree with the national standards described with the ECVET learning outcomes.\r\nOn the school website a monitoring and reporting system is being created to check the students\u2019 career not just during and after the trainings abroad but after leaving school to see how they progress. With comparing the career of this group to the control group - students not involved in any foreign training \u2013 we could check the success of the mobility program.\r\nOur aim with putting through this project is to grow up young adults who are self-confident and successful in their profession and with it they enhance the reputation of our school.

Student and staff mobility have been identified as critical success factors in reaching the objectives set for international activities. \r\n \r\n\r\nThe aim is to increase our students, teachers and work life partners\u2019 professional and international skills by offering them a possibility to participate in the international mobility programs. By enabling our students and teachers to acquire new skills and knowledge the quality of education increases as well as student\u2019s employment opportunities. At the same time, Hyria fosters the co-operation with the world of work and serves the needs of the area\u2019s working life by producing a highly skilled workforce. \r\n \r\nObjectives and expected results\r\n\r\nThe most important objective is to increase the students\u2019 professional skills, knowledge and attitudes by emphasizing the acquisition and development of key competencies of lifelong learning.\r\n \r\nThe exchange period comprehensively enables students to develop the key competencies which are needed for personal fulfilment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment. During the exchange period students encounter new situations; they apply already gained knowledge and language skills in practice; learn to use new technological solutions and platforms while communicating with their teachers, friends and family in the home country; and they compare working methods, the acquisition of technical solutions, the level of sustainable development and legislative issues in the host country.\r\n \r\nIn addition, students are able to develop international and personal capabilities such as cultural awareness, language skills, interpersonal skills, individual growth, independence and the ability to work in a multicultural environment. For teachers the project activities give a possibility to update their professional knowledge and understanding of current requirements of a working life.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of this experience the students and teachers\u2019 professional identity gets stronger, and they are able to find out more field-specific professional development possibilities. It enriches the education in many ways, as well as encourages students\u2019 to entrepreneurship and language learning. \r\n\r\nThe second objective is to continue the development of international activities at Hyria. In this time the development activities are focused on the following issues: \r\n\r\n- The current development activities are evaluated and established into practise.\r\n- Mobility statistics will be improved.  The estimated numbers are compared with the implemented ones by departments and target groups.  \r\n- Creating a uniform way to mark the exchange period into students\u2019 transcript of records.\r\n- Shifting from short-term co-operation agreements to long-term ones (MOU, LOI).\r\n- Creating a centralized mobility process, instructions and orientation to teachers and staff members. \r\n\r\nMobility\r\n\r\nThis application comprises 70 student mobility covering 25 different vocational qualifications. Principally exchange periods are offered to Hyria\u2019s second or third year students (young), but also to adult students and recent graduates can participate.
