School Development plan planned activities which will have impact on various functional areas of the school. Within each of these areas the school sets various goals and tasks which arise from the need to meet many diverse needs of both the school as a whole and to its individual components: teachers, executives, students.\r\n1. Improving methods of teaching science subjects and foreign languages, expanding the range of various teaching aids to increase students' motivation, expanding the use of digital technologies in teaching, increasing the importance of the method of projects in science education.\r\n2. Improving language skills of foreign language teachers and increasing language competence of other educational staff and management, thereby increasing students' motivation to learn foreign languages.\r\n3. Modification of teaching programmes to correlate with extramural classes in order to use CLIL.\r\n4.
