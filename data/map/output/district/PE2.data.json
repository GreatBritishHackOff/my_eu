Liquefied natural gas (LNG) enables gas markets to be connected with more distant export sources thereby improving market competitiveness and stability. Effective thermal insulation is critical to energy management throughout the LNG value chain, impacting on competitiveness and profitability. Furthermore, durability and fire protection are important to ensuring safety and protection of capital infrastructure.\n\nExisting insulation systems are based on cellular foam or powder insulation structures, pipe-in-pipe vacuum insulated structures, or hybrid systems combining foam / powder and vacuum. Whilst cellular and powder materials are low cost, they are time consuming to install, rapidly degrade under cryogenic temperatures and are fixed in place preventing routine inspection. Whilst offering high performance, vacuum systems are expensive, complex to install and rapidly lose their vacuum with time. None of the existing systems offer adequate fire protection. The CryoWrap project will develop a highly innovative LNG insulation system incorporating emerging geopolymer & aeroclay material science & novel production processes, achieving:\n\n\u2022 Enhanced insulation performance and service lifetime (improved energy & maintenance cost efficiency)\n\n\u2022 High jet fire resistance performance for protection of infrastructure assets (Prioritising safety and added value)\n\n\u2022 Energy efficient production of standardised and unique insulation half shell shapes (reduced environmental impact & cost competitiveness)\n\n\u2022 Rapid on-site installation (greater flexibility and reduced installation costs)\n\n\u2022 Efficient removal & re-installation (enabling routine inspection & ease of maintenance)\n\nThe global LNG insulation market is worth >\u20ac1 billion.

Reducing this will be important if Europe is to achieve ambitious emission reduction targets, reduce its excessive reliance on imported energy and the decrease costs to households and industry. The most effective way to decentralise energy production is to increase the amount of generation at source, in this case within the home. A common barrier to the adoption of most energy saving technologies is the high initial investment cost which results in long payback periods considering current energy prices. However, with prices on the rise, existing technologies such as solar thermal heating systems and heat pumps are becoming increasingly popular. Although both are reasonably efficient, existing solar thermal heating systems generally only provide up to 60% of a typical household\u2019s annual hot water demand. Air source heat pumps are more effective and can provide up to 100% of total household heating requirements but their performance decreases significantly in winter and they suffer from frost-build up. As these technologies are becoming commodity products, SME\u2019s in these markets are coming under increasing pressure from cheap and often unreliable imports from Asia.  It is therefore paramount that European SME\u2019s keep a technological edge over these competitors. We therefore propose to develop a novel solar air source heat pump system which is 25% more efficient than a typical air source heat pump and 7% more efficient than a combination of a standard ASHP and a solar thermal system while only costing 60% of the combined price of these separate systems.

It addresses resource scarcity and enhances security of material supply, while contributing to higher energy efficiency and lower environmental impacts. Moreover, recycling offers significant investment, innovation and employment opportunities in the EU.

The current concerns about the health effects of vehicle emissions and the scandal around manipulated diesel engine emissions in passenger cars shows there is a need for disruptive and timely solutions. The Alsitek NOXTEK solution is a retrofit technology that goes beyond the current state of the art in terms of NOx mitigation (over 85%), with the capability to absorb large amounts of NOx over long time and excellent regeneration capabilities. NOXTEK meets several end-user needs in the diesel passenger cars market, including (i) an efficient NOx-mitigation solution to ensure compliance with the tightening environmental regulations (ii) the need for an ergonomic retrofit solution not affecting the warranties of the car\u2019s subsystems and components (iii) a solution that can be applied in a de-centralized manner by technically adept end-users or at service points. The product is expected to be 78% more cost-effective than available retrofit solutions. Alsitek aims to target the diesel passenger car aftersales market first (to be confirmed in Phase 1). Adjacent markets to be targeted include diesel engine applications in low and heavy-duty vehicles, marine vessels and peaking power plants. NOXTEK is expected to save 6.2 tons of NOx emissions annually from the fifth year after market entry, which is an equivalent of 1847,6 tons of CO2.
