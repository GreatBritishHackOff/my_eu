It builds on previous excellent work already evident in the school with a previous partner school in France, We now have a link with a school in Perpignan which has outstanding ICT practice which we are keen to learn from. We have already set up an e-Twinning Project and eager to learn how to use the space effective to enhance pupil learning.\r\n\r\nOur project focus will be around the enhancement of ICT and language skills, knowledge and understanding in the first instance, amongst staff, but with the aim of raising attainment of our pupils in these two areas. The nature of the Structured Training course which we are applying for dictates that the European Dimension be a key element of the project and will be part of pupils learning experience.\r\n\r\nWe beleive that our school is very well placed at this point in time to look outwards to learn from our colleagues in France about a broad and balanced curriculum. We feel that the last few years have been spent focusing on Literarcy and Numeracy to the detriment of other creative experiences for children. This project will inspire future generations to be good citizens of Europe.", "http://www.westgrove.enfield.sch.uk", "West Grove Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036101_coordinator"], ["4UJ", "E.A.S.Y. VET - Experiences Abroad for Staff and Young graduates in VET", "Ecoluxe London Ltd", 383642.0, "The project \"E.A.S.Y. VET - Experiences Abroad for Staff and Young graduates in VET\" foresees the realization of:\r\n- 70 mobilities lasting 122 days (of which 120 of traineeship and 2 of travel) addressed to recent graduates that will perform a traineeship in companies located in the following countries: United Kingdom, Spain and Ireland.\r\n- 20 mobilities lasting 14 days (of which 12 of training and 2 of travel) and addressed to the staff of VET Institutes and organizations. \r\nThey will carry out the training experience in companies set in Spain.\r\nThe professional sectors in which the traineeships and the training/job shadowing activities will be performed are: \r\n- Tourism and Catering\r\n- Fashion Industry and textile production\r\n- ITC, Communication and new media \r\n- Marketing, Commercial Services Sales, Administration and accountancy\r\n- Electronics and electrotechnics; mechanical engineering/mechatronics\r\n- Socio-sanitary field \r\n- Engineering, environment and territory\r\nTherefore, beneficiaries of the mobilities will be, respectively,  recent graduates that have obtained the title of study in one of the aforementioned sectors, and staff from Institutes, entities and VET organization operating in those fields. \r\nThe projects was born to meet  the training need- in terms of practical experience- of recent graduates, and to favour the entry (and the permanence, in the case of the staff) in a globalized labor market that requires the mastery and the updating of knowledge, competences and abilities both sectorial and personal and transversal (intercultural, linguistic, in IT, entrepreneurial). \r\nThe needs of the VET world and the necessities of the job market have been noticed by Essenia UETP srl starting from the debates occurred during the informative and training meeting that the company periodically realizes at National level, face-to-face and virtually.  The analysis realized starting from these activities of discussion and sensitization highlighted the need of implementing transnational mobility activities for the strengthening and updating of professional competences, both of recent graduates and staff, in the sectors identified in the project. In fact, they are sectors extremely relevant for the national economy (tourism, fashion, commerce), constantly increasing (ICT, electronics/electrotechnics, mechanical engineering/mechatronics, marketing), and in which the request of specific competences has grown (social field, mechanical engineering/mechatronics,  environment and territory). \r\nBesides the technical-professional competences related to the identified sectors, the project contributes to enhance the European identity and to improve intercultural, linguistic and digital skills, allowing the development of a set of personal and transversal abilities, essential in the current occupational scenario. \r\nThe realization of the project \"E.A.S.Y. VET - Experiences Abroad for Staff and Young graduates in VET\"  is part of the internationalization strategy of Essenia UETP, that foresees the implementation and the development of activities aimed at improving the quality and increasing the quantity of transnational mobility projects. \r\nBesides the transversal phases of management, monitoring and dissemination, the project foresees the implementation of the following activities, carried out according to procedures and methodologies already experimented over the years, and that guarantee high quality standards:\r\n-Information and sensitization\r\n-Selection of participants\r\n-Linguistic and pedagogical preparation\r\n-Logistic organization of mobilities\r\n-Evaluation of the project\r\n-Dissemination of project results\r\n-Follow-up\r\nThe quality procedures adopted are constantly improved and updated, also thanks to the use of new technologies and to the professional retraining of Essenia UETP\u2019s human resources, that occurs through training activities realized in the framework of Erasmus+ KA2 projects. Over the years, Essenia UETP  has further broadened its already wide network of European partners, identifying entities and companies able to offer transnational mobility experiences meeting high quality standards and preferring , among them, the ones of proved experience.  All over the National territory relationships with VET Institutes, public and private entities, companies have been consolidated  to assure congruence and coherence between the activities proposed and the needs of the users. At local level, Essenia UETP pursues  the objective of enhancing the cooperation with the bodies in charge of implementing the approaches and of adopting European methodologies and tools for the certification and validation of the competences (ECVET), in order to make the  formal and informal competences acquired by the participants during the mobility experiences more spendable on the labour market.", "http://www.ecoluxelondon.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005687_20"]]}}, "outwardCode": "N14"}
