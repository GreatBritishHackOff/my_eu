As the use continues to grow, methods of recycling the waste materials are being developed. Whilst methods exist to recycle materials containing Carbon Fibre, these are not high value and tend to involve crushing and burning, which themselves are not environmentally friendly. This proposal will highlight the use of yarns, tapes and consolidated Matt virgin fibre materials for use in higher value recyclate with better properties which will substitute current materials with lighter, more efficient recycled materials. A number of commercially available polymer fibres soluble in epoxy based resin are available for use in thermoset composite manufacture (eg PEI, PES). These matrix soluble fibres can be blended with chopped recycled carbon fibre or waste carbon fibres to produce hybrid spun yarn to be achieved high performance thermoset composite form low value materials. The main benefit of this technology is uniform blending of recycled CF with resin soluble fibres, which will be dissolved in the epoxy resin during composite fabrication.  It is expected that by integrating the recycled fibres into current state of the art materials development, a wide range of high value, lower carbon footprint materials can be developed. Currently the ability to manufacture woven fabrics in 2 Dimensions and 3 Dimensions is available, as well as Multiaxial NCF materials. This ability to convert a wide range of substrates into useable fabrics and materials will provide better opportunities for realizing the higher value available from the recycled fibres.

This proposal considers not only the engagement of SMEs into the research process but also enabling SMEs to access developed knowledge and competencies of the research community. In addition to the science-push programmes, it looks into the demand-pull initiatives where the focal SME drives the process. The work puts a strong emphasis on the SMEs of lower absorptive capacity and how to open up their horizons to external research capabilities. Our hypothesis is that if Europe manages to upgrade a significant part of those SMEs, the economic and social benefits will be enormous. The work is deployed through a \u201cfunnel\u201d strategy: a) identify the requirements of different types of SMEs b) an Expert Judgment Survey (1000 experts) to map the full range of existing initiatives, c) create key performance indicators to measure their impact, e) investigate in depth the top performing initiatives and f) develop benchmarks for public, private or public-private partnership schemes.

The aim was to help policymakers and support agencies to develop programmes and practices that will spur innovation and growth.", "SMEs are powerhouses of innovation and important drivers of the economy. The EU-funded 'RAPPORT' project aimed to help SMEs to access research capabilities that were of high quality and appropriate to their level of development.\n\nThe project outlined good practices and benchmarks to strengthen knowledge exchange and technology transfer between SMEs and research organisations in the public or the private sector. It mapped SME research support mechanisms focusing on public programmes or public\u2013private partnerships. These steps are meant to produce the ideal economic climate and innovation policies to advance SMEs within the European Research Area (ERA).\n\nRAPPORT developed a thorough methodology to investigate the interaction between SMEs and organisations offering access to available research. The project looked into how to strengthen SMEs' ability to articulate its innovation needs, identify the right source of expertise, integrate the acquired knowledge and exploit it commercially. The project team looked at 331 national, regional and local programmes that supported knowledge and technology transfer for SMEs. It interviewed 481 programme stakeholders, including 305 programme managers, 32 KTT enablers (agents, network brokers etc.), 37 knowledge providers (researchers) and 57 beneficiary SMEs.\n\nThe project distinguished between SMEs with high absorptive capacity and SMEs with low or medium absorptive capacity. It differentiated between the programmes and the practices that were appropriate for each group of SMEs. \n\nThe analysis of this project provided a clear insight into the challenges faced by KTT programmes. KTT programmes should be able to provide the means to HAC SMEs to enable them to engage in meaningful innovation and commercialisation activities. KTT programme should also be able to detect those LAC SMEs that have a poor track record of innovation and KTT, but possess the willingness to innovate and grow. Finally KTT programmes should be able to engage with those LAC SMEs that have no obvious interest or appetite for innovation and alter their attitudes and their behaviours in order to convert them gradually into SMEs of higher absorptive capacity.\n\nThree generic strategies were identified to cope with these challenges.  This included agent-supported programmes, firm-incentive programmes and network-based programmes. The agent-supported and the network-based programmes possess the greatest potential for behaviour change and innovation. Agent-supported programmes are more frequent with the low absorptive capacity SMEs, while the network-based programmes fit better the requirements of high absorptive capacity SMEs. Firm-incentive programmes (like the innovation voucher schemes) can provide resources for KTT and innovation but have little potential for behavioural and attitude change.\n\nA number of reports were produced to further knowledge transfer and assist SMEs. Among these was a set of good practices that were converted into proposed actions and activities for for policy-makers at the European Commission, plus the national or the regional level. This was followed by five roadmaps for different programmes or services to support SMEs in order to integrate the findings of the project into the ERA and the EU's Horizon 2020 programme.\n\nThe findings were also presented at a major conference for SME support and innovation in Denmark and through the project's advanced website.

Colonoscopy in combination with the assessment of biopsy samples is considered the reference standard for diagnosis of all IBD. However, the procedure is invasive and requires extensive bowel preparation, which is considered very burdensome by most patients.

Therefore we will introduce new innovative starter cultures for improving the flavour and texture of low-fat Mozzarella-type cheeses and optimize appropriate processing conditions of temperature, pH, milk fat and casein-to-fat ratio in the milk. Furthermore, we will develop an innovative oil coating process for improving the meltdown of the low-fat cheese after it is shredded in the meal in preparation.

The project is developing a mozzarella-type cheese with less than 3\u00a0% fat that would taste much better than low-fat varieties available on the market.\n\nTo achieve its aims, the project team is isolating novel starter cultures to enhance the texture and taste of low-fat mozzarella-like cheeses, improving processing stages related to acidity, milk-fat ratio, casein-to-fat ratio, melting factor and temperature. It is also creating an oil coating process of cheese shreds to improve the properties of the cheese without all the fat.\n\nThe initiative, which brings together 11 partners from several European countries, businesses and research centres, began by investigating the latest advances in low-fat cheese-making. It found that low-fat mozzarella improves with higher moisture content, less calcium and improved proteolysis, brought about by better starter cultures and processing. After screening 100 microbial cultures and culture combinations for proteolytic ability and other characteristics, the project team chose eight cultures that displayed better performance. These cultures were further developed with optimised growth media and scaled up before being tested in cheese-making.\n\nIn parallel, CHEESECOAT made significant progress in developing a promising fat-based emulsion coating, based on dairy-derived ingredients, to enhance melting behaviour of cheese, aiming to optimise its results in the future. In addition, a spray-coating equipment for in-line application of the coating on shredded cheese have been manufactured. So far, the results have been very good, paving the way for more research and for new mozzarella-type cheeses to hit the market.\n\nArmed with these developments and advances, the small and medium-sized businesses under the project are expected to increase their market competitiveness.
