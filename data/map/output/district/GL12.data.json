A further aim is to achieve 50% cost reduction for finished parts, compared to traditional processing.\n\nThe project will design, demonstrate and deliver a modular streamlined work-flow at factory level, offering maximum processing flexibility during AM, a major reduction in non-added-value delays, as well as a 50% reduction in shop-floor space compared with conventional factories.\n\nAMAZE will dramatically increase the commercial use of adaptronics, in-situ sensing, process feedback, novel post-processing and clean-rooms in AM, so that (i) overall quality levels are improved, (ii) dimensional accuracy is increased by 25% (iii) build rates are increased by a factor of 10, and (iv) industrial scrap rates are slashed to <5%.\n\nScientifically, the critical links between alloy composition, powder/wire production, additive processing, microstructural evolution, defect formation and the final properties of metallic AM parts will be examined and understood. This knowledge will be used to validate multi-level process models that can predict AM processes, part quality and performance.\n\nIn order to turn additive manufacturing into a mainstream industrial process, a sharp focus will also be drawn on pre-normative work, standardisation and certification, in collaboration with ISO, ASTM and ECSS.\n\nThe team comprises 31 partners: 21 from industry, 8 from academia and 2 from intergovernmental agencies.

The consortium consists of 29 partners, and will operate between January 2013 and June 2017.\n\nAfter the first year, the project is on schedule. After initial recruitment and organisational planning, the team progressed to basic testing, quality control, upgrade of the AM equipment, and other developments.\n\nTo date, large batches of materials have been procured. The AM equipment is functioning, samples have been made, and new alloys and structures have been designed and tested. The project is working on development metrology and in-process monitoring. New standards are emerging and being applied within the standardisation community. Preparations have been made for second-year work, to include production of AM test samples and intermediary parts, and comparative benchmark tests.\n\nDuring the first year, the project also received substantial media exposure.\n\nThe outcome of the AMAZE project will be a considerable improvement to AM technologies, leading to superior manufactured products.

This facility would be the first of its kind in the world and would represent a significant advance for metallurgy. The novel technology that enables this HTT facility is based on automated, direct laser deposition (DLD). The key feature of this technology is the way in which a mixture of elemental powders is accurately and directly fed into the laser's focal point, heated by the laser beam, and deposited on a substrate in the form of a melt pool, which finally solidifies to create a unique fully-dense alloy button with precise stoichiometry. This robotic alloy synthesis is 1000 times faster than conventional manual methods. Once produced, these discrete mm-sized samples are submitted to a range of automated, standardised tests that will measure chemical, physical and mechanical properties. The vast amount of information will be recorded in a 'Virtual Alloy Library' and coupled with computer codes such as neural network models, in order to extract and map out the key trends linking process, composition, structure and properties. The most promising alloy formulations will be further tested, patented and exploited by the 20 end-users.
