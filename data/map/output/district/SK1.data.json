Since the September 11th terrorism attacks in the United States, catering services through-out the world have been seen as the weakest link in the aviation industry\u2019s service supply chain. Existing sealing technologies are time consuming, ineffective and require a complex paper trail. A reusable and retro-fit, electronic sealing device is therefore required with an ultra-low profile. This new technology will enable the automatic sealing and inspections of galley trolleys, while improving their security by utilising a digital, anti-tamper volumetric sensor. With an initial market value of \u20ac120million retrofitting the technology and an additional \u20ac24milion per year in new trolleys, this market has the potential of significant economic returns. Beyond the catering industry this technology will enable international logistics services and all of the SMEs operating within a secure supply chain to seal their vehicles and reduce their operating costs. Supported by a location dependant (Galileo) tag interrogator and central ICT database, a pair of smart tags will be used to seal and monitor unauthorised access to a trolley, based on a received signal strength indication technology. Upon an authorised activation, the novel security seal will transmit its location and a randomly generated locking number to a central database, using a mobile GPRS communication link in the tag interrogator. By cross-referencing the tag and database values using a standard RFID reader, a security official may ensure that a seal has not been tampered with or replaced. A multi-lingual and bi-colour passive RF display will be installed onto each door of the trolley, for a visual indication of the seal status. Alternatively a RFID reader may be used for an automatic, long range inspection.", 434548.0, 1139572.0, "AIR-SEAL", null, null, null, null, "http://www.maplefleetservices.co.uk", null, "fp7_107791_997831047"], ["3EY", "Second Generation Unit Load Device to improve the Security and Efficiency of the Aerospace Logistics Industry", "Maple Fleet Services Ltd", "The SAFEGUARD project presents a new technology to improve the security and efficiency of air cargo through the research and development of a second generation Unit Load Device (ULD). With 1 million ULDs around the world worth over 900 million Euros, they are a crucial element of the global aviation industry. For example, in 2009, 80 million tonnes of air cargo was carried by the existing ULD fleet. However, 26 million tonnes of this cargo (33%) was transported on passenger aircraft and industry experts agree that air cargo is the weak link in the supply chain. Considering the potential security problems around the global air cargo supply chain, there is an urgent need to review and improve existing technological solutions. Over the last 20 years, incremental improvements have primarily focused on weight reduction, which has resulted in compromised security within the supply chain. The research and development of the SAFEGUARD technology will result in a step change improvement in the security of air cargo supply chain, in addition to large economic savings and logistics improvements for airlines. The proposed technology will overcome the existing security concerns in the supply chain, as well as reducing the ULD weight, minimising supply chain imbalances for ULD availability and the current high maintenance requirements. Following the research program, the new technology will enable our SME consortium partners to jointly commercialise a new product, with forecast revenues of 105 million Euros to 2020 and significant advancements in air cargo supply chain security.", 151270.0, 1100820.0, "SAFEGUARD", "Better aviation cargo containers", "Unit load devices (ULDs) are special containers for aviation cargo, and generally arrive at the aircraft pre-loaded. While very successful and ubiquitous, they also represent the weakest link in aviation security.", "The EU-funded SAFEGUARD project aimed to develop an improved device. To begin, the eight-member research group reviewed existing technological solutions for improving aviation cargo security without increasing weight. Objectives included developing a prototype of a lightweight, hard-sided ULD having a stacking density greater than 4:1.\n\nThe project also planned to simulate a sealing system, based on electronic locking technology and including radio frequency identification (RFID). The two-year project concluded in September 2013.\n\nAfter a phase of preparatory research, the project pursued three avenues of technical development. These were: design and optimisation of a folding polymer-reinforced ULD; development of a prototype electronic sealing system; and exploration of power harvesting.\n\nThe project pursued an advanced nesting concept, leading to patentable improvements to ULD design. The new concept yields a stacking ratio of 3:1, which addresses the global imbalance of ULD availability. The use of reinforced polymers reduces weight of the secure design while also reducing maintenance costs. \n\nTeam members also studied RFID systems, focusing on international legislation, approved products and transmission protocols. A comprehensive analysis of regulations and technical criteria resulted in the decision to adopt a multi-frequency approach. The multiple frequencies available for listening and response mean a design able to be used anywhere.\n\nThe project team also developed a handheld reader with integrated Wi-Fi and 3G connectivity. The device allows RFID tracking information to be exchanged and stored. The ID information interfaces with a project-developed on-board locking system, which includes a new 12C protocol integrated by project partners. The hand-held device uses an electronic Dallas iButton key for users not wishing to establish an RFID system. Power optimisation tests were performed to increase battery life.\n\nThe group also developed a passive energy-harvesting device, incorporating information tracking and security sealing applications. Developments include a low-power data logger that records the time of impacts. The information can be stored for long periods and interfaced to a computer.\n\nSAFEGUARD helped to improve the technologies used to secure aviation cargo. The developments also mean considerable cost savings for airlines.", null, "http://www.maplefleetservices.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/149393.jpg", "fp7_101433_997831047"], ["3XE", "Supporting Independent LiVing for the Elderly through Robotics", "Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council", "The SILVER project has two concrete primary objectives. The first is to establish and validate a Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) process in the participating countries. The second is to use that process to identify new technologies and services to address the challenge of Supporting the Independent living of the Elderly through Robotics.<br/>By the completion of this project there will be a fully documented PCP process, capable of being run as a joint cross-border PCP call for tender with the participating countries. Together with this process there will be supporting artefacts, such as application forms and document templates, which can be used by procurers wishing to run a PCP call. Additionally, the awareness and procurement competencies of local, regional and national public/private purchasers in the field of elderly care and of public authorities running research activities will have been upgraded.<br/>For addressing the independent living of the elderly a number of pilot research and development projects will be executed to develop innovative new solutions and technologies. These projects, identified through an open call using the PCP process, will run through a  3 phased life-cycle. This life-cycle will start with short feasibility studies to allow selected highly innovative ideas to be tested in a controlled way to mitigate the inherent risk that innovation brings. Those ideas that prove their viability will then go through a further selection process. The most promising projects will then be selected to develop prototypes and the most promising of those further again into small scale test series of first end-products and thus accelerate their route to commercialisation.<br/>By involving purchasers of care services for the elderly as partners within the SILVER project, we will provide these R&D pilots with intelligent lead customers able to assess and shape the solutions.

Human intervention is costly but the severity can be prevented and/or mitigated by simple changes in self-perception and brain stimulation mediated by robots.\nThe proposal is coordinated by the nursing unit of NUI, involves managers of the City of Stockport developing social care and community support programs to older persons, and also involves an important hospital in Italy pushing research boundaries in comprehensive geriatric assessment. Pilot activities and interaction with caregivers, older persons and stakeholders (within a standards based medical assessment methodology) is present from beginning to finish and provides a user led design ethos. \nThe proposal brings together the well-known Kompai platform and commercial footprint of ROBOSOFT, control expertise of RURobots, advances from the computer laboratory at CNR, and an innovative robot application development platform by Ortellio. Dedicated telecommunication (CNET) and exploitation experts (R2M) widen technical and market outreach potential. From this unique combination, clear advances are made in the use of semantic data analytics, personal interaction, and unique applications tailored to better connect older persons to their care providers, community, own social circle and also to their personal interests.
