A great advantage of BANUS approach is to be able to guarantee food safety when using recycled materials (plastic and paper) even coming from non-authorized recycling processes in food packaging structures.\nThe project will consider the substitution of a percentage of virgin material by recycled material (paper or plastic) in the selected structures in order to develop more environmental friendly food packaging structures. As the main requirement of food packages is always to guarantee food safety for consumers, this substitution will be achieved after evaluating the functional barriers positioned between recycled layers and foodstuffs.", 204391.0, 1124881.0, "BANUS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.deltapack.com", null, "fp7_188540_952493635"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9JF", "D\u00e9velopper ses comp\u00e9tences et son employabilit\u00e9 dans l'Union Europ\u00e9enne", "Belfast International Language Academy", 34100.0, "Context :\r\nMonts du Lyonnais vocational High School is located in the Monts du Lyonnais area (a rural area) in Chazelles sur Lyon. We attach great importance to external openness and we are involved in many European cooperation activities since 2005 (European Section, Comenius school partnerships, work experience for students in Denmark and Northern Ireland, Comenius Assistant, European Youth Parliament, DNL certification, Comenius in-service training).\r\n\r\nObjectives :\r\nOur objectives are to encourage mobility in the EU and to help our students to gain skills ( knowledge, abilities and attitudes) in order to improve their personal development and their employability on the labour market and also to ensure a better recognition of the skills acquired during their work experience abroad ( Europass, Europro certificate, Europass CV, European Section...) to facilitate post-secondary studies.\r\nWe also wish that our students as well as the teachers involved can improve their linguistic skills.\r\nOur aim is also to raise intercultural awareness throughout our school. We hope that by participating in this project, we can establish international networks and thus develop within our school a sense of European citizenship and European identity.\r\nWe hope that these internships abroad will improve the transnational cooperation between our school and the companies abroad.\r\nFinally, we would like to develop our managerial and organisational skills to facilitate the organization of internships abroad and to improve the international dimension and the attractiveness of our school.\r\n\r\nDescription of activities :\r\nWe intend to organise a 4-week work experience in March 2018 ans a 4-week work experience in March 2019 in Northern Ireland  and Poland for about 16 students in their last year of BTEC National in Business and Marketing studies, Business and Administration studies and in Logistics studies. Our students will benefit from the supervision of 2 French tutors for each destination and each mobility who will supervise their work programme and progress.\r\nA steering committee will be established and will meet once a month to manage the practical and logistics aspects of the project :\r\ninformation meetings, enrolment of students, linguistic and intercultural preparation, travel,  contact with intermediate organization, follow-up of students, assessment, preparation of administrative documents ( insurance, social security, traineeship agreements, assessment grids...).\r\n\r\nExpexcted impacts and outcomes :\r\nWWe hope that this project will enable our students to obtain European diplomas and certificates which will facilitate their post-secondary studies. We also wish that this experience, added to a greater linguistic ease, will make them more mobile in the European labour market and will facilitate their professional integration.\r\nAt the level of the school personnel, we think that this project will enable to develop and improve the whole educational community \r\nthrough the acquisition of innovative educational tools to prepare  internships abroad. Being involved in this project will enable them to improve their mastery of a foreign language.\r\nAt the level of the school, this project will enable us to develop our foreign companies network, to improve our practices in the organization of work experiences abroad and to widen the scope of our European actions (Erasmus+KA2).\r\n\r\nPotential benefits in the long term :\r\nWe think that this project will allow us to give new impetus to the whole educational community which will enable to multiply the projects, to expand the scope of the European actions into more levels and fields of  training and to involve a larger number of staff in the school.\r\nWe hope that the school will integrate more and more the dimension of European citizenship and European identity at all levels.\r\nWe wish that this project will enhance our international profile at the local, regional and international level.", "http://www.bil.academy", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-035739_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT11"}
