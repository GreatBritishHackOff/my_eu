A great advantage of BANUS approach is to be able to guarantee food safety when using recycled materials (plastic and paper) even coming from non-authorized recycling processes in food packaging structures.\nThe project will consider the substitution of a percentage of virgin material by recycled material (paper or plastic) in the selected structures in order to develop more environmental friendly food packaging structures. As the main requirement of food packages is always to guarantee food safety for consumers, this substitution will be achieved after evaluating the functional barriers positioned between recycled layers and foodstuffs.", 204391.0, 1124881.0, "BANUS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.deltapack.com", null, "fp7_188540_952493635"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT11"}
