The market is expected to grow a further 6% in 2012, and approximately 50% of revenues are generated from sales to European manufacturers.  The large increase in uptake observed since 2004 has primarily been driven by recent developments in solid-state laser technology leading to the commercial availability of fibre-delivered Yb-fibre, Yb:YAG disc and direct diode laser sources, which have resulted in improved capital cost and reduced operating costs.  However, despite these cost reductions and potential benefits, the uptake of laser welding technology is still limited, especially amongst SMEs, for three related reasons: complexity, lack of flexibility, and difficulties in using lasers for \u2018non-standard\u2019 welds.\n\nMost existing laser systems are fitted with either a standard process head or a 2D galvanometer scanner \u2013 both of which deliver a \u2018standard\u2019 Gaussian or \u2018top-hat\u2019 energy distribution to the work piece.  However, this relatively simplistic energy distribution is not directly suitable for many applications and significant laser welding expertise is required in order to develop acceptable process parameters. Laser beam welding with a tailored energy distribution produced by a galvanometer beam scanner is possible, but this technology is not economically attractive. Diffractive optical elements are a robust, simple tool and are capable of producing (virtually) unlimited tailored energy distributions.\n\nThe aim of the TAILOR:WELD project is to develop and demonstrate an innovative laser welding system, that uses simple and robust diffractive optical elements, which will increase the flexibility and simplify the application of laser welding; removing the key barrier to entry for a large number of SME fabricators.", 28661.0, 1294041.0, "TAILORWELD", null, null, null, null, "http://www.graham-eng.co.uk", null, "fp7_111008_951895533"], ["8SY", "Development and Pilot Line Validation of a Modular re-configurable Laser Process Head", "Graham Engineering Limited", "State-of-the-art fibre-delivered laser sources are an industrially accepted tool for performing a range of materials processing applications. Despite the unrivalled capability of fibre-delivered laser sources to perform a wide range of processes, the potential flexibility of the laser source is limited by the need to change the processing head for these processes to be performed. The majority of industrial laser systems are employed to perform low-variety and high-volume manufacturing operations. However, current manufacturing trends (such as increased automation, individualisation and next-shoring) are driving the need to develop manufacturing systems which are capable of performing a higher variety of manufacturing operations.\n\nThe ModuLase project will develop a re-configurable highly flexible processing head system, which will be capable of covering  welding, cladding and cutting.
