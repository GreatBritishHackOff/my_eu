According to the WHO the burden of cancer can be reduced by systematic and equitable implementation of evidence based strategies for cancer prevention, early detection and management of patients with cancer.  33% of the cancer burden could be reduced if detected early and treated adequately. The WHO concludes that, early diagnosis of cancers could save the developed world an average of \u20ac40 billion per year on medical costs and \u20ac80 billion per year on realized productivity. The direct savings on medical treatment alone would be more than \u20ac10.000 per patient if early detection was possible. Early cancer diagnosis today consists of recognition of some of the \u2018early\u2019 signs by the patient themselves or detection from screenings carried out on specific population groups.    If something suspicious is found the next step is to perform a blood analysis and/or to look with non-invasive imaging techniques.

Today, only a biopsy and the subsequent pathologist\u2019s interpretation can give a definitive diagnosis of cancer  and this is not always enough EDOCAL will use a tunable blue laser to selectively excite an accumulated photo sensitizer, called proto-porphyrin. This sensitizer is taken by the patient to enhance contrast between healthy and cancerous tissue. Reflected light is filtered using state of the art ultra narrow photonic crystal technology. Initial studies have shown that it is possible to detect cancerous tissue using blue light in combination with FDA approved sensitizers (ALA-5 and Proto-Porphyrin). This tool will be based on the principle of preferential retention of proto-porphyrin by cancer cells. The purpose of this project is to create a breakthrough tool for early cancer detection by combining state of the art laser and imaging technology with leading medical research.", 35483.0, 1562673.0, "EDOCAL", "Early cancer detection by laser", "Early detection of cancer saves lives, improves quality of life and reduces health care cost.

EU-funded \u2018Early detection of cancer using photonic crystal lasers\u2019 (http://www.edocal.eu (EDOCAL)) project aims to create a breakthrough tool for early cancer detection.\n\nCell in the tumours tend to create additional blood vessels to support their growth. The molecule protoporphyrin (PpIX) is generally present in blood vessels and exhibits red fluorescence when excited with blue light in the 375 - 425 nm range. Cancer cells could be detected by observing the red fluorescence at a matching excitation wavelength. To increase the intensity of the red fluorescence, a porphyrin prodrug (Pp) can be administered either orally or locally to create additional PpIX in the cancerous tissue. By using a tuneable laser system and combination of endogenous fluorescence and exogenous fluorescence (produced by administration of a Pp), it is possible to accurately distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue.\n\nDuring 2 years of the project researchers developed tuneable blue laser system for research purposes. The spectra from 290 sites in the oesophagus of 77 patients were registered and showed that it is possible to detect early cancer with 80 % sensitivity and 81 % specificity. Proof of concept has been achieved for early detection of cancer based on a tuneable blue laser technology. The first patent application has been filed and new filings for the latest results are under way.\n\nThe project achieved the goal of creation of the device that can be used as the first line cancer detection.

The Attainment Challenge is underpinned by the documents The National Improvement Framework, The Curriculum for Excellence, and \u2018Getting it right for Every Child\u2019 (GIRFEC).  In 2014 Sue Ellis and Edward Sosu completed research for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation entitled \u201cClosing the Attainment gap in Scottish education\u201d, Its key findings proved to be difficult reading, and it prompted the government to explore equity in education.

By age 12\u201314 (S2), pupils from better-off areas are more than twice as likely as those from the most deprived areas to do well in numeracy. Attainment at 16 (the end of S4) has risen overall, but a significant and persistent gap remains between groups.\u201d (Sosu and Ellis, 2014)\r\n\r\nThis information prompts brave new thinking and a bold approach.  It is necessary to look outwards, across Europe, to seek inspiration and learn from the most effective models and practices. \r\n\r\nWe have reflected on our own practice and read widely about international approaches to Early Years Education, however, it is necessary to create our own pedagogy, a Scottish Model. The approach we wish to take inspiration from is the Reggio Approach. The diverse cultures and socioeconomic circumstances welcomed by our nursery necessitate a non discriminatory, encouraging, inclusive approach. Every child and family must have a voice. The Reggio Approach is unparalleled with their confidence in the children's competencies and the ability to listen to every child's voice is truly valued. \r\n\r\nThe project therefore aims to address 3 specific areas in order to enhance and innovate:\r\n\r\nLeadership and Management\r\nLearning Provision\r\nSuccesses and Achievements\r\n\r\nBy addressing these 3 areas, the project main objectives are :\r\n\r\n- Develop innovative approaches to our teaching and learning\r\n- Develop an understanding of creative approaches\r\n- Improving our teaching and learning by raising staff expertise and competences within a European context\r\n- Develop an understanding of practice in Europe\r\n- Improve children's outcomes by developing new learning methods and strategies\r\n- Develop links with schools in Europe\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve our objectives we have planned to provide opportunity for 12 staff to attend a structured training course in Italy ''Creative Teaching in Early Years and Preschool Education, Bologna.\"  \r\nThe course offers a unique opportunity, not only will be on location in Emilia Romagna but the training team are very specialised in their expertise regarding neuro-lingustics and child development.

Adjuvant staff, many of whom are ex-Scottish FA education and mobility employees, are now involved in the delivery, assessment and management of circa 250 Modern Apprentices employed by the Scottish professional football clubs who are undertaking the SVQ Level 3 qualification, Achieving Excellence in Sports Performance.\r\n\r\nFor those intent on a career in professional football, the path starts at the age of 16, when clubs offer apprenticeships to their most promising young players. Although aspects of the two-year training programme have changed significantly, the goal remains the same: a professional contract.\r\n\r\nHowever, the statistics are damning. The Premier League and Football League advise that between 60% and 65% of the 700 or so apprentices taken on each year are rejected at 18. Even half of those who do win a full-time contract will not be playing at a professional level by 21 years of age (source: PFA). Effectively, this means that five out of every six players who start an apprenticeship will not be playing football for a living five years later.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation reports published by a number of organisations (Scottish FA, Celtic FC, Aberdeen FC) have unequivocally shown that participation by young apprentice players in a European mobility programme can boost their chances of being offered a professional contract. Celtic and Aberdeen FC have reported that almost 30% of mobility participants subsequently went on to play first team football \u2013 an unprecedented success rate. This recent (2015) club data confirms that European mobility undertaken by apprentice players can profoundly affect their chances of becoming professional footballers. Both of these clubs went on to report that mobility also had a marked effect in boosting employment rates in other industries for those mobility participants who were not offered a professional contract. Consequently, the anticipated  impact of this mobility project will be to significantly increase the skill sets of the mobility participants which will improve their prospects of being offered employment as a professional player on completion of their apprenticeship. Those participants who are not offered a professional contract will benefit from increased employability in alternative career pathways due to the transferable and interpersonal skills acquired as a direct result of their mobility experience.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this mobility project will be to provide a work experience abroad that not only enriches apprentices\u2018 professional and academic lives, but will also promote openness, adaptability and flexibility, and enhance language learning, intercultural skills, self-reliance and self-awareness.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objectives of this project is to use the competencies and life skills acquired through mobility to enhance the future employability of participants, whether that be as a professional football player or an alternative career path. Evaluation will include the collection of employment data (post apprenticeship) for mobility participants and comparing this to their peers.

The partner network of Omnia has enlarged by adding Austria and Latvia and new project countries during the last project period. Now our intention is to include even Portugal and Lithuania in this KA1-project. This because we at Omnia, also according to our international strategy, want to offer opportunity for international experiences (mainly in the form of on-the-job learning periods abroad) for possibly many students and from all Omnia vocational fields. In Lithuania we would have two new co-operation fields: logistics and property maintenance and that's why this new partner and country interests us. In Portugal the fields would be hotel, restaurant and travelling and in those fields we have had lack of placements and partners in relation to our applicants from those fields. From the security field Omnia has not either yet had any international activities, because we have now educated this field only for one year at Omnia, but we would find out if any of our existing partners also educates  this field and our objective is to start international co-operation also in this field during this new project period. \r\n\r\nFrom the last projects countries Slovakia will be excluded, because students have not applied there and co-operation was not implemented with the country last year either. Omnia's biggest partners are vocational institutes in Europe, but also a few Chambers of Crafts in Germany are included in this project and they also act as our reciprocal partners, which means that Omnia does not only send students to Germany via them but also receives students from them to practice in Finland in many different fields.\r\n\r\nOmnia has plenty of direct company co-operation in Europe, but because most of co-operation companies abroad act without pic-codes, they are not included in this application. Our intention is to include them later as receiving organizations when implementing the project. \r\n\r\nOmnia's one strategical objective is to offer internationalization opportunities for the whole staff, not only for teachers. That's why Omnia offers possibility to apply expert grants also for administrative personnel, guidance counselors, college nurses, curators, Omnia youth workshop personnel and staff of college canteen personnel. One project objective would also be to use a few of expert grants to reinforce co-operation between Omnia and local Finnish companies, who regularly receive foreign students via Omnia to practice at them. Reinforcing would happen by offering the key persons of those companies an opportunity to make an international mobility period of one week by themselves. \r\n\r\nInternationalization is already built in Omnia Curriculum in the form of one new learning unit called: To be a professional internationally.\r\nStudents can carry out this learning unit by doing an on-the-job training period abroad but also by doing their practicing period at some international company in Finland in case the company language is English.\r\n\r\nMost of the applied grants are single grants, which we coordinate one by one but also try to form pairs or small groups of students to each target country. In this application we apply many group mobilities: for instance a 10 student group in the field of AV-communication to Germany for 12 days, 5 students from social- and health care to Ireland for a month, 5 -student -group in the field of joinery to Estonia for 2 weeks (because our partner has a better CNC-machine than Omnia) and 8 student group from the fields of electricity, plumbing, joinery and house building to the Netherlands for three weeks. We apply grants for accompanying persons to travel with groups, because students in these fields are young and would not dare travel without a safe adult.\r\n\r\nInternational project work, including international mobility periods, will be handled both in the applying phase and during the actual working period of each project, in Omnia's pedagogical development team.

The request for information and enquiries about mobilities is now at an all-time high, from across all areas of the curriculum.\r\n\r\nWe have run an ongoing internal communications campaign to publicise and promote the Erasmus Mobilities which uses all forms of media \u2013 from leaflets, to broadcasts on the portal, to running roadshows, a presentation to all academic areas, and the publication of a complete Mobility Handbook.  The campaign has been nominated for a College Development Network Marketing award - the winner to be announced on March 9th.\r\n\r\nProject 2-DARE therefore involves reviewing the current year\u2019s programme, involving departments in reviewing their experience and turning the strategy into a series of yearly objectives as per the application.

There will be discussions concerning the schedule and programme, and staff will also relate to their opposite number to identify issues in advance. Staff will receive briefings on assessment and support issues, inc. ECVET, and travel arrangements will be handled by the administration section of the International team as well as an external travel company. The Mobility + tool will be used to record the mobilities and other information that is created, as Project 2-DARE progresses.
