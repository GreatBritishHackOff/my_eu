According to the WHO the burden of cancer can be reduced by systematic and equitable implementation of evidence based strategies for cancer prevention, early detection and management of patients with cancer.  33% of the cancer burden could be reduced if detected early and treated adequately. The WHO concludes that, early diagnosis of cancers could save the developed world an average of \u20ac40 billion per year on medical costs and \u20ac80 billion per year on realized productivity. The direct savings on medical treatment alone would be more than \u20ac10.000 per patient if early detection was possible. Early cancer diagnosis today consists of recognition of some of the \u2018early\u2019 signs by the patient themselves or detection from screenings carried out on specific population groups.    If something suspicious is found the next step is to perform a blood analysis and/or to look with non-invasive imaging techniques. Current imaging techniques are widely used in diagnostic procedures but they cannot give conclusive evidence of  cancer. Today, only a biopsy and the subsequent pathologist\u2019s interpretation can give a definitive diagnosis of cancer  and this is not always enough EDOCAL will use a tunable blue laser to selectively excite an accumulated photo sensitizer, called proto-porphyrin. This sensitizer is taken by the patient to enhance contrast between healthy and cancerous tissue. Reflected light is filtered using state of the art ultra narrow photonic crystal technology. Initial studies have shown that it is possible to detect cancerous tissue using blue light in combination with FDA approved sensitizers (ALA-5 and Proto-Porphyrin). This tool will be based on the principle of preferential retention of proto-porphyrin by cancer cells. The purpose of this project is to create a breakthrough tool for early cancer detection by combining state of the art laser and imaging technology with leading medical research.", 35483.0, 1562673.0, "EDOCAL", "Early cancer detection by laser", "Early detection of cancer saves lives, improves quality of life and reduces health care cost.

Today, only a biopsy and the subsequent pathologist interpretation can give a definitive diagnosis of cancer and this is not always sufficient. EU-funded \u2018Early detection of cancer using photonic crystal lasers\u2019 (http://www.edocal.eu (EDOCAL)) project aims to create a breakthrough tool for early cancer detection.\n\nCell in the tumours tend to create additional blood vessels to support their growth. The molecule protoporphyrin (PpIX) is generally present in blood vessels and exhibits red fluorescence when excited with blue light in the 375 - 425 nm range. Cancer cells could be detected by observing the red fluorescence at a matching excitation wavelength. To increase the intensity of the red fluorescence, a porphyrin prodrug (Pp) can be administered either orally or locally to create additional PpIX in the cancerous tissue. By using a tuneable laser system and combination of endogenous fluorescence and exogenous fluorescence (produced by administration of a Pp), it is possible to accurately distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue.\n\nDuring 2 years of the project researchers developed tuneable blue laser system for research purposes. The spectra from 290 sites in the oesophagus of 77 patients were registered and showed that it is possible to detect early cancer with 80 % sensitivity and 81 % specificity. Proof of concept has been achieved for early detection of cancer based on a tuneable blue laser technology. The first patent application has been filed and new filings for the latest results are under way.\n\nThe project achieved the goal of creation of the device that can be used as the first line cancer detection. This device will reduce the need for biopsies, make the diagnosis more reliable, less dependent on human interpretation and make early cancer detection available to more people.", "http://www.edocal.eu", null, "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58269.jpg", "fp7_95907_991614026"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8LE", "SYMBOLS - Culture of Death & Cultural Life: New audiences and creations around European Cemeteries!", "DUNDEE AND ANGUS COLLEGE", 152775.0, "SYMBOLS is an innovative interdisciplinary cooperation project that pretends to create and test new approaches to discover European Cemeteries, in order reinforce the knowledge and public awareness on its hidden heritage.Among its key objectives, we can highlight:1) The exchange of cultural and creative works, reinforcing the cultural and creative sector\u2019s capacity to operate transationally, through the mobility of artists (printmakers, dancers and musicians) and their work, as well as of cultural and creative players (cultural managers/decision-makers)2) Audience development, by using the cemeteries as interactive \u201copen-air museums\u201d that can be visited, focusing on young people and on people with disabilities (blind and deaf people), to stimulate interest and improve access to such tangible heritage, as well as improve the skills and competences of key players  in working with such audiences.3) Promote the use of digital technologies (Augmented Reality Browsers) to create new routes of \u201csymbols\u201d to discover this hidden heritage, as well as to work and test them with the new audiences (young people and people with disabilities)As far as its results are concerned, we can mention:- Participation and test with at least 120 young people from 6 countries- Creation of 6 \u201croutes of symbols\u201d by the young people on ARTOUR mobile application.- Adaptation of ARTOUR to the needs of blind people (3 pilot tests in Maribor, Avil\u00e9s & CC Nebbiu)- Joint artistic residences for 15 printmakers (etching, lithography, silkscreen, relief, monoprint, etc.) from 7 countries- Joint artistic residences for 5 dancers and 10 musicians from 6 countries- Coproduction of 1 multidisciplinary exhibition open in 2016 in 7 countries, 9 places: objective 27.000 visitors (3000/place)- 3 Manuals of Good Practices to be transferred to +-1000 stakeholders through Workshops and networking activities - Particip. of +- 100 blind people and +- 100 deaf people - Strong ICT & Media communication", null, null, "creative_551981-CREA-1-2014-1-ES-CULT-COOP1_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DD3"}
