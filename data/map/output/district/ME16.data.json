Firstly, some of our language staff need to improve their language competences and would greatly benefit from attending languages courses abroad.  Secondly, our school as a whole needs to improve its international dimension and make links with other EU schools.  Finally, our school has invested a lot of money in a wireless network which is currently under-used and we really need some training and support in how students can more effectively use mobile devices in the classroom to facilitate their learning.  We therefore would like to send 4 members of the MFL department on language training courses in France, Spain and Germany and 4 school-wide staff to observe excellent use of student mobile devices at a school in Sweden.  \r\nThis would have a huge impact on the school:  language staff would feel more confident in their languages and would be able to provide for some of the very able students we have at our school. The ideas and advice we would get from visiting the school in Sweden would enable us to effectively re-write our schemes of work in all subjects and be pioneers in this field for the local community to learn from.  The links we would make would also allow us to boost the international dimension of our school and promote students to be internationally thinking and curious to find out more about other cultures.", "http://www.mggs.org", "Maidstone Grammar School for Girls", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013297_coordinator"], ["8AH", "School European Professional Dev Project", "Oakwood Park Grammar School", 1705.0, "Our management team has identified that we have strong existing international links however these opportunities are not always accessible to all students within the school and our students would benefit from becoming much more internationally aware in the particular context of Europe. \r\n\r\nThe Languages Department would like to increase the confidence and further increase the proficiency in French, German and Spanish of all five experienced staff within the department. In particular, native speakers would like to increase their proficiency in their second or third languages and non-native teachers would like to increase their fluency in their first teaching language and increase their second language skills.  We hope that this will increase flexibility of staff and enable us to increase language provision across the school. Furthermore, we anticipate that there will be more opportunities for collaboration and the sharing of good practice between Languages Department staff; as a larger number of staff will be able to teach a wider range of key stages. We hope that the upgrading of department members' language skills will  mean that staff return with improved language competencies, incredibly enthused and more knowledgeable of their respective target language cultures.  It is hoped that this enthusiasm will be transferred to pupils via improved classroom practice and therefore, create more enthusiastic language learners of the future. \r\n\r\nThe Languages Department is also undertaking a three Associate Department project with the Prince's Teaching Institute with the aim of increasing awareness of target language culture to improve the motivation in MFL learning . Therefore, they would like non-native staff to further increase their knowledge of target language culture.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the links made with other staff on the in-service training will prove very useful in further developing our very successful e-twinning and exchange projects.\r\n\r\nThe impact of all the above will be tangible in the increased quality of language provision within the school and this will be of direct, positive benefit to our students and hopefully encourage them to be more active EU citizens in the future which we, as a school, feel is incredibly important in our increasingly globalised world.\r\n\r\nThis training, for us, will be the starting point of a continuous process of international CPD for teachers in our department.", "http://www.opgs.org", "Oakwood Park Grammar School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013300_coordinator"], ["0SF", "Assessment as Learning", "Maidstone Grammar School for Girls", 7056.0, "Activity A: \r\nAt Rudbeck we have during a few years been teaching according to Dylan Wiliams' five key strategies. The model is referred to as Assessement for learning. This way of working has been part of all teaching at Rudbeck the last few years. Now we feel that it is time to move forward to assessement as learning, a model aiming at making students even more metacognitively aware of their learning. We are interested in finding out how to outline a plan to develop teaching in this direction. We have become aware that Maidstone Grammar School for Girls in Maidstone, Kent, United Kingdom has already come far in teaching according to assessement as learning and therefore we would like to visit the school to learn from their experience. We are two teachers from Rudbeck, Lena Nor\u00e9e, lead teacher in Swedish and Nina Andersson Kvist, lead teacher in English, who intend to job shadow  teachers at Maidstone Grammar School for Girls during a few school days. We want to learn everything about how they have gone about to educate the rest of the teachers at Maidstone Grammar School for Girls and how they have implemented the way of working at the school. We also want to see how they are working in the classroom with Assessment as Learning.  \r\n\r\nBefore leaving for England, we will have discussions with our principal and our colleagues about the needs of assessement as learning at Rudbeck to become aware of what we need to focus on specifically when at Maidstone Grammar School for Girls. We will also study current research on the subject . We will also speak to students  to find out in what way they feel that they learn more from having to reflect upon their work in a metacognitive way. \r\n\r\nAfter visiting  Maidstone Grammar School for Girls, we will inform our principal and our colleagues everything we have learned about assessement as learning, at meetings and other pedagogical conferences. \r\n\r\nActivity B:\r\nFor over twenty years Rudbeck has developed a partnership with this school in northern Spain. Last year, a group of teachers, also in the context of job shadowing, visited our partner school in Bologna where the teachers followed the lecturing in MFL and explored how target language is used in teaching and text editing.\r\n\r\nWe want to continue studying teaching methods in other European countries and see whether the Common European Framework Reference for Languages (CEFR) is used as assessment tool and the importance of modern languages in the different school systems.\r\n \r\nOur partner school in Spain uses the same technological working tools as used in our school. One of our overall goals is to improve student achievment by using the formative assessment strategies. Also important for this achievment are oral and written textual editing, students feedback and awareness of the learning. How do our colleagues in Spain use the students  own results? How do they use these as resources in the classroom? Is CEFR an important element in their assessment?\r\n\r\nWe also want to see how integrating new technologies in the classroom affects students learning in other cultural environments. \r\nWith this and the previous visits to the other european countries, we would like to create a common method in which our students work as a network inbetween different countries beeing a resource to each other in their learning. We want to find a common model so that students can assess cross-border work and contribute with their own examples that could be used as a model.", "http://www.mggs.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA101-038894_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "ME16"}
