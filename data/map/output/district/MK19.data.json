This integration would be used to stimulate creativity and accelerate the identification of viable and effective solutions to real problems, and hence to drive both current research and technology transfer.LACE will create and curate a knowledge base of evidence. This will capture evidence for the effectiveness and the relative desirability of the outcomes resulting from use of various tools and techniques.LACE will actively participate in the exploration of plausible futures for learning analytics and EDM by combining the creation of imaginative scenarios with participatory workshops and structured methods including a Policy Delphi to assess differences of opinion about the feasibility and desirability of possible future states, thus informing future research and policy agendas.", 16750.0, 1110593.0, "LACE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_189096_987590078"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["7ES", "EUROPEAN DISTANCE AND E-LEARNING NETWORK LBG*", 46271.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2016_56083", 2016], ["7ES", "EUROPEAN DISTANCE AND E-LEARNING NETWORK LBG*", 52954.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_30750", 2017], ["7ES", "EUROPEAN DISTANCE AND E-LEARNING NETWORK LBG*", 49711.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_55906", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "MK19"}
