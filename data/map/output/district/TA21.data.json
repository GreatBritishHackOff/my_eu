This 4 year project will establish a European network of creators to encourage and support creativity, innovation and art production, support and develop emerging talent and assist the creation, distribution and monetisation of art.Our focus will be on creativity in an urban context, with an emphasis on music, digital art and street art. We will explore this through a series of co-created, co-curated and co-produced events, residencies, laboratories and conferences bringing together experienced cultural players and creative organisations from cities across Europe: Bristol, Bergen, St. Etienne, Aix en Provence, Liepaja, Cornella, Zagreb, Berlin and Kuopio, and further afield in Quebec. Through a collaborative process of skill sharing, learning from the experiences of others, citizen engagement and artist, audience & community development, we will join forces to:* create a new platform for the sharing of emerging, innovative and collaborative art across Europe* create a cohort of artists able to develop and engage a wide range of new and diverse audiences across the world* create new ways for art to engage with and stimulate communities. This will have the power to affect positive social changes throughout EuropeThis network will act as an incubator for cultural innovation and new practices in creativity by stimulating risk taking through the development of challenging artworks in challenging circumstances. Collectively we will:* strengthen connections between citizens, communities and creativity* create a vision for the future of art which engages communities not only as consumers but as creators* empower and enable citizens to shape and build stronger communities through participatory artistic, creative processes* build and develop new audiences across the world* create an ecosystem for a sustainable creative economy", "http://www.superact.org.uk", "SUPERACT!
