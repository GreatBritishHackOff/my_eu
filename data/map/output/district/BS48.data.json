The demo line resulting from this project will be such that it will enable first critical process module development by combining imec infrastructure with tools remaining at the site of the manufacturers (distributed pilot line). Multi-site processing will allow partners to participate in the world first 450mm integration studies and will be enabled by the controlled exchange of 450mm wafers between different sites.  \nThe consortium comprises 43 members (from 11 different European countries) with many SMEs and research institutes. The project is organized in five technical work packages and a work package on management and coordination.  \nIn the work package on integration and wafer processing first critical modules will be developed and will demonstrate the feasibility of processing on 450mm wafers.\nThe main objective in the work package on lithography is to develop a wafer stage test-rig, which can be implemented into the pilot line system.\nIn the work package on front end equipment several tools will be developed such as a plasma ion implant module, a plasma dry etch module, a RTP system and a single wafer cleaning system.\nFurthermore, in the dedicated work package on metrology 450mm metrology tool types will be developed for amongst others dielectric film thickness and composition measurements, defect inspection, defect review and analysis, optical critical dimensions (CD), overlay (mask and wafer) and 3D metrology.\nFinally, from the work package on wafer handling and automation a set of equipment will be provided to support the demo line operations, and facilitate the R&D dedicated to process and metrology modules.", 223645.0, 160396543.0, "E450EDL", null, null, null, null, "http://www.metryx.net", null, "fp7_201972_985700421"], ["4DD", "Semiconductor Equipment Assessment Leveraging Innovation", "Metryx Ltd", "SEAL is a project for an integrated project consisting of 17 equipment assessment sub-projects in the area of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The assessment themes are equally spread amongst processing and metrology equipment, heading beyond the current state-of-the-art both for More Moore and More than Moore applications. The strategic objective of SEAL is to effectively combine efforts, resources and expertise in the joint assessment of novel equipment supported by cross-cut R&D dedicated to the identified needs of the assessment sub-projects.For Lithography, the key areas of illumination systems for mask aligners, EUV mask manufacturing and intelligent overlay management are addressed as well as massively parallel e-beam lithography. In addition, three important processes are addressed: low temperature oxidation, cleaning of sensitive interconnect stacks/structures and ion implantation for ultra shallow junctions and defect engineering. For metrology and analysis, the main focus is on enabling innovative systems to efficiently contribute to at-line and in-line monitoring and control within semiconductor facilities. Without such equipment, it will not be possible to validate progressively advanced processes during development and manufacturing.Cross-cut R&D activities relating to all equipment assessment sub-projects are covered including APC, model based control, equipment simulation, enhanced wafer and equipment logistics, advanced communication and man machine-interfaces, and virtual equipment engineering. A common approach for the assessment activities will be utilised with specifications that will be refined for each equipment type for the progressively emerging technology nodes.Overall, SEAL will strengthen the European equipment manufacturing industry in an ideal and sustainable way by combining advanced R&D topics in equipment sub-projects involving a wide community of users, research institutes and equipment suppliers with many SMEs.", 279991.0, 11868543.0, "SEAL", null, null, null, null, "http://www.metryx.net", null, "fp7_95776_985700421"], ["1BS", "adaptive model-based Control for laser-assisted Fibre-reinforced tape winding", "Ge Oil & Gas Uk Limited", "ambliFibre will develop and validate the first intelligent model-based controlled laser-assisted tape winding system for fibre-reinforced thermoplastic (FRP) components. This system will include optical non-contact monitoring and innovative Human-Machine-Interfaces, which are easily manageable for the worker. Based on thermal and optical models embedded into integral process simulation tools combined with novel machine and laser technologies, for the first time a tape winding system will be realised which is able not only to drastically reduce the occurring waste, but also predict potentially arising failure in order to reduce machine downtimes. Statistical reliability and maintenance models for detection of critical elements and definition of their reliability will also prevent sudden machine breakdowns and allow defining the most cost-efficient maintenance schedule. \n\nThus ambliFibre will be a major breakthrough for the continuous and discontinuous production of neuralgic tape-winded tubular composite components, such as gas tanks for automotive application, pressure vessel housings for the desalination of sea water or composite ultra-deep-water risers which are all affected by rapidly changing product requirements concerning both, material and design. With respect to changing and challenging environmental influences, quick adaptability, failure-free quality and safe operation over the complete life-cycle are mandatory. \n\nThe successful application of the ambliFibre results will dramatically accelerate the replacement of metal components in these domains, reducing the carbon footprint thanks to the low weight and long life cycle of FRP components and provide new opportunities for European manufacturers in global, high-value multi-billion \u20ac markets.\n\nambliFibre is conceived as a small collaborative project lasting 36 months and will be submitted to the call FoF 14 \u2013 2015:  Integrated design and management of production machinery and processes.", 191461.0, 3963931.0, "ambliFibre", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_198352_951591535"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["3SF", "RVJ", "BARROW HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BS48"}
