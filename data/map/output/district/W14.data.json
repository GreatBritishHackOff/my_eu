In 2000 41 significant attacks on aid workers were recorded across the globe. By 2014, that number had risen to 190. In this 15-year period, over 3,000 aid workers have been killed, injured or kidnapped. Despite the increasing availability of tracking and monitoring technologies, the number of humanitarian workers that fall victim to attacks continues to rise. Clearly, a novel and innovative approach to tracking and decision-making is needed.  \nInformation systems for fleet management, GPS for navigation and location or RFID tags for inventory management are just a few of the technologies that have changed the humanitarian operations. Until now, however, there is no integrated decision support system that provides real-time analyses from the data streams that are generated by these technologies.  This lack of integrated real-time information prevents an understanding of potentially threatening situations, increases response times and creates insecure communications, all leading to inadequate protection and hampered efficiency and effectiveness.\nThe aim of better protection and more efficient and effective operations can only be achieved by developing technologies along with the policies for their use. GPS, for example, notwithstanding its capability to provide live tracking of vehicles for recovery, cannot prevent an ambush or kidnapping. Technologies therefore need to go hand in hand with procedures and policies in order to provide useful early warnings to decision-makers on the ground as well as decision support for scheduling, navigation, risk management and coordination.

We have therefore decided to continue the implementation of such projects with the new title \"My Mobility - Experience, Expertise, Quality.\"\r\nThe involvement of such students in international projects and their personal experience with working abroad can break stereotypes and broaden the horizons in the area of job diversity within their expertise and rid them of their fears and worries of mobility.\r\n\r\nThe practice will be held in 2 two-weekterms - September 2017 and September 2018 for students of the 4th year in London, Havirov, and Katowice. \u00a0 Students with special educational needs may also apply for the foreign experience of mobility, thereby improving their \u00a0chance to succeed in the labor market and gain an advantage over other candidates.The main objectives of the planned project are to improve vocational education with an emphasis on the compulsory subject of professional experience and other economic subjects in our school, to prepare students for the labor market, to ensure their readiness for lifelong education and thereby improve the indicator of unemployment of our school graduates.\u00a0\r\n\r\nStudents participating in foreign mobility aim to improve their hard and soft skills which are needed in the modern work environment, particularly: improving the ability to work independently, problem solving, enhancing presentation skills, developing verbal and language skills, and improving self-knowledge and self-reflection.The aim of the teaching staff is to gain direct experience with the foreign labor market and with the current requirements of graduates, to expand conceptual and organizational competencies and to improve the management skills of the project team.\r\n\r\nOther objectives of the project are to design and verify the ECVET methodology in the process of preparation, implementation, and evaluation of mobility, to ensure certification through the Europass system, to improve the organization of teaching and learning and integrate new knowledge into the \u0160kVP \u201cgraduate profile\u201d, to implementthe skills and practices acquired by teachersinto the following subjects: professional experience, accounting, business economics, administration and correspondence, English language, and the labor market.\r\n\r\nWe consider the implementation of professional practice in enterprises and organizations in London, Havirov, and Katowice to be the goals concerning students and teachers. Students will have the opportunity to communicate in the real businness environment in person and in written form with business partners and with employees of the company, they will also archive accounting documents, process payrolls, check and register the contracts, carry out business activities and small projects in the area of marketing, update databases, and more. The students will acquire completely new skills and knowledge within the field of modern office equipment and software use.\r\n\u00a0\r\nProject management will carry out project tasks according to the established plan. Based on feedback from participants, the management will constantly improve those areas in which a need of improvement will be identified. As a result of the project, a foreign professional experience will be implemented for 29 students who will receive the Europass Mobility and Certificates of intermediary organizations, modified school educational program and the introduction of new forms and methods in the learning process. We see long-term benefits in improving the index of unemployment, which, however, can only beevaluated in time.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOur long term goal is to improve the position of our graduates in the job market as well as to decrease the rate of their unemployment. We hope to see the synergy between theoretical and practical knowledge in students to be strengthened.", "http://www.winmarkglobal.com/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SK01-KA102-035042_11"], ["0HN", "From theory to practice", "Winmark Ltd", 55929.0, "The Business Academy, Topolcany (OA TO) is a secondary vocational school founded in 1968.

This paper has been authorized by the Board and directors of several educational programs.  This policy, among other things, means that Graafschap College aims to make its students and employees use their full potential, so that the region profits and is able to market itself.  To get experience in and outside the region, is very good for students\u2019 and employees\u2019 development. More than ever before, Graafschap College aims to prepare and create opportunities for its students and employees in a changing globalising world.  Besides, it wants to be an attractive school which offers its students and employees to acquire knowledge, skills and experience. Graafschap College actively participates in cooperations and official administrative structures such as Achterhoek 2020, Platform Onderwijs Arbeidsmarkt and Provincie Gelderland because of its Human Capital Agenda. In its new strategic plan 2015 \u2013 2020, Graafschap College has set out five strategic lines, specifically educating in a network within Euregio and its international global context.  By means of this application Graafschap College tries to shape its objectives, such as described in its charter and translated in the framework paper ambitions. Also, Graafschap College is co-financer in making available FTEs to run the project, USA Exchange, and it makes available financial means for potential mediation in internships. Also, excellence funds are used for international mobility. \r\n\r\n\r\nStudents Beside the curricula which are known to participate in Erasmus+ applications for a number of years, there is also an interest in this application from students in our IT department, educational assistents, facility services and catering. In total, subsidy is requested for 259 students (N= 241 last year). An important development, also mentioned in the charter, are our contacts with the German  Berufsschulen. 350 students participated in an international Euregio activity (Appendix 2, numbers). Graafschap College also welcomed 175 students and 10 teachers from Germany.  Keuzedelen internationaal are offered in several teams as of next year. \r\n\r\nImportant developments with regards to this: \r\n\r\nGraafschap College is secretary and leader of the \u2018Learning without Borders\u2019 project. This project runs from September 1, 2016 up to August 31, 2020. This European and mainly Euregional project focusses on border crossing connection between professional education programs, and by doing so contributes considerably to an integrated, Euregional labour market in which it speaks for itself that people can be hired on either side of the border, after their professional education.  The project partners aim for a double qualification and mutual recognition of certificates obtained in the Euregion.  \r\n\r\nSince a short while, Graafschap College has a work relationship with Hogeschool Rhein Waal in Germany. Its focus is to give students from the Graafschap College chances to study after their exams for a higher level at this school. It is also a chance to follow courses at this school for employees.\r\n\r\nThere are also plans to start a commonly organised school (Graaf Willem V college)  somewhere in the Netherlands \u2013 Germany border area, where students graduate who meet the criteria in both the Dutch and the German market\r\n\r\nTalented Engineering students have been enrolled in its Plus program  since 2016; 4 Engineering students have worked on a development project in Gambia, together with Stichting Bouwen Nederland as well as the local population. This cooperation is continued in the years to come. \r\nThis year a number of students in the Automotive department together with a regional garage company, will start a project in Ethiopia as part of their excellence program. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, an application was done this year for MIJN SCHOOL for 6 students. Many of these students have had only little opportunity to meet people outside of their relatively limited social circle. We also applied for funds for one accompanying person. \r\n\r\nIn this application the Graafschap College applied for three teams of employees for subsidy; the team of building services for Denmark ,the team of commercial and legal services for Germany.and the team of employees for training co-teaching with EQF level 1and 2.  The Main topics are:\r\nExchanging knowledge and skills in a certain professional areas, with a focus on innovative methods\r\nImproving a foreign language, in most cases German or English\r\ncooperation in the future with these schools\r\ntraining for co-teaching\r\n\r\nSome employees of the department of health and care Graafschap College applied for subsidy for individual internships abroad. They already described their personal and professional skills they would like to learn in schools or companies abroad.
