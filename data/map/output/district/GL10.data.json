The consortium will explore already existing poplar and N. glauca genotypes in parallel with innovative state-of-the-art translational research from the model organism Arabidopsis to genetically engineer metabolic pathways to advance qualities of wood fibers, and long-chain fatty acids. The modulation of fiber and long-chain fatty acid quality in both poplar and N. glauca will be examined through a multidisciplinary analytical platform that will optimize for key industrial values. An extensive cross-talk between the analytical platforms, biorefining and field trials will provide the basis for industrial determination of N. glauca and poplar varieties as new multi-purpose feedstocks. Importantly, residual biomass, e.g. suberin in poplar bark, that normally is considered waste products will also be analysed for its potential to yield long-chain fatty acids with important characteristics for new bio-materials and for biorefinery purposes. Both poplar and N. glauca may readily be grown in areas that are sub-optimal for food crop-species, and field-trials within the MultiBioPro project will further evaluate the environmental sustainability of the obtained poplar and N. glauca genotypes. Attributes that are advancing biorefinery and bio-material properties will be further exploited for marketing, demonstrating the industry-driven nature of the MultiBioPro consortium. Dissemination and training events will constitute an integral part of the project, and will include training modules in using different analytical platforms, industry-lead product-developing courses, management training and communication through the development of corporate and scientific dissemination toolkits.", 198629.0, 5836021.0, "MULTIBIOPRO", "Exploiting tree tobacco and poplar for green bioproducts", "Researchers are using varied feedstocks for biorefining to produce high-value bioproducts that have industrial applications.", "Fossil fuels are diminishing and their use causes severe environmental damage. With a focus on ecological compatibility, biorefining has stepped into the spotlight to sustainably produce biofuels and other bioproducts.\n\nOne way to advance the quality and output of this process is to improve the primary source materials. The EU-funded http://www.multibiopro.eu/ (MULTIBIOPRO) project was established for this purpose.\n\nIt aims to exploit the natural resources from tree tobacco and poplar varieties to produce novel industrial end-products. These plants hold many other advantages: they are non-food crops, grow in sub-optimal regions, require relatively few resources and can be used to accumulate heavy metals from contaminated ground.\n\nThe project has successfully characterised numerous plant genotypes with altered material properties to use as multipurpose feedstocks. Researchers have also established technology platforms to assess the chemical and structural profiles of these modified plants for performance and functionality.\n\nAdvanced extraction methods are providing feedstocks for a pilot biorefinery, which will be up-scaled in the near future. Through these advances, MULTIBIOPRO has boosted the marketability of biomass for biorefining, prompting industry partners to develop business strategies and models to unlock economic value.\n\nThis project will provide new insight into the enhanced use of renewable and sustainable energy sources.
