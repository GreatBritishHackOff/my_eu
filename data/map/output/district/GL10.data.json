The consortium will explore already existing poplar and N. glauca genotypes in parallel with innovative state-of-the-art translational research from the model organism Arabidopsis to genetically engineer metabolic pathways to advance qualities of wood fibers, and long-chain fatty acids. The modulation of fiber and long-chain fatty acid quality in both poplar and N. glauca will be examined through a multidisciplinary analytical platform that will optimize for key industrial values. An extensive cross-talk between the analytical platforms, biorefining and field trials will provide the basis for industrial determination of N. glauca and poplar varieties as new multi-purpose feedstocks. Importantly, residual biomass, e.g. suberin in poplar bark, that normally is considered waste products will also be analysed for its potential to yield long-chain fatty acids with important characteristics for new bio-materials and for biorefinery purposes. Both poplar and N. glauca may readily be grown in areas that are sub-optimal for food crop-species, and field-trials within the MultiBioPro project will further evaluate the environmental sustainability of the obtained poplar and N. glauca genotypes. Attributes that are advancing biorefinery and bio-material properties will be further exploited for marketing, demonstrating the industry-driven nature of the MultiBioPro consortium.

These plants hold many other advantages: they are non-food crops, grow in sub-optimal regions, require relatively few resources and can be used to accumulate heavy metals from contaminated ground.\n\nThe project has successfully characterised numerous plant genotypes with altered material properties to use as multipurpose feedstocks. Researchers have also established technology platforms to assess the chemical and structural profiles of these modified plants for performance and functionality.\n\nAdvanced extraction methods are providing feedstocks for a pilot biorefinery, which will be up-scaled in the near future.
