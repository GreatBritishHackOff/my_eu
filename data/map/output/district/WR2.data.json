Our aim is to meet the demands of these diverse markets providing a high performance, low maintenance solution with reduced energy usage and superior operational performance which our extensive market research has validated a significant commercial interest in our objectives.\nEZ-Liner offers major advantages in trenchless relining for long runs of pipe in a single operation with associated reduced labour, reduced energy costs, reduced disruption and reduced time for pipe repairs. By utilising a thermoplastic liner, instead of traditional epoxy methods, the risk of contamination from such chemicals will be eliminated. The traditional methods are labour intensive and expensive, typically \u20ac300 to \u20ac350/m2. Our method will improve relining speed by 100% achieving a target cost of \u20ac230/m2 by minimising labour. By developing a novel liner delivery system that focuses the heating and consolidation of the pipe to a narrow band we aim to reduce energy consumption by at least15%. Uniquely our design will achieve consolidation, even in pipe work with surface defects.\nThe system will utilise a conformable thermoplastic liner drawn through the pipe by a novel consolidating head. This will clear debris in the pipe by water jets, form the liner in the pipe and consolidate with locally produced steam providing reduced energy usage and losses. Focusing steam into a localised area avoids escape into surroundings or damaged pipe, as is prevalent in traditional methods. The system we will deliver will be safer and more robust making it simpler to operate and easier to maintain; ideally suited for the harsh environment of the pipe relining market.\nThe system will be primarily validated in the drinking water pipe relining industry.

More than 2.6 billion cubic metres of drinkable water (30\u00a0% of the overall quantity) are wasted through leaks, which also represents an energy loss. In London alone, 890 million litres of water are lost each day through pipe cracks. Repairs are difficult, slow and costly, but European legislation on drinking water quality is forcing the need to find relevant solutions.\n\nWith EU support, the project 'Novel technology for low cost re-lining of pipe infrastructure' (http://www.ezline.info/ (EZ-LINE)) developed technology that eliminates the need to completely replace old pipes. As a trenchless technology, this system does not require excavation to rehabilitate pipes, but only access to the pipe ends.\n\nThe EZ-LINE solution is a low-cost system and does not incur any increase in the infrastructure cost. Furthermore, it has low-maintenance needs, reduced energy usage and superior operational performance.\n\nTo retrofit old pipes, the EZ-LINE system coats them with a thermoplastic liner from the inside. Compared to other trenchless rehabilitation methods, it does not have any harmful resins and is quick to install as well as ecologically sound, thus conforming to European standards. This conformable thermoplastic fabric is pulled through the pipe, pushed against the inner surface of the defective pipe, heated and consolidated by a novel pig-head design.\n\nDuring consolidation, the liner fabric partially melts to form a smooth, watertight solid sheet of reinforced plastic. Optionally, the liner can be braided with reinforcing fibres. This increases its burst strength, helping it to withstand high water pressures.\n\nConsortium members successfully demonstrated the EZ-LINE rehabilitation process at a partner institute. The relining process was carried out using prototype equipment at a speed of 6\u00a0metres per hour. This speed is expected to increase significantly when using commercial equipment with higher capacity.\n\nThe EZ-LINE system should serve both residential and municipal markets, ensuring continuing function of Europe's pipe networks. This innovative relining method could also be further developed to serve in the oil and gas sectors.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/149721.jpg", "fp7_96345_990997882"], ["6AJ", "Implementation of a dynamical Pollen Module and the transformations of the pollen including feedbacks in a numerical Weather Forecast Model", "University of Worcester", "The main goal of the proposed project is to provide an advanced mathematical model (WRF-BioChem) for modelling the emission, dispersion and concentration of bioaerosols at the regional scale. The model will with this development be able to handle feedback mechanisms between biology, chemistry and weather. The model is developed to go beyond state-of-the-art by developing the mathematical model for oak pollen and by doing it at the species level. The project supported by a three companion projects on grass pollen, fungal spores (Alternaria) and pathogens \u2013 all at species level. These projects deliver the needed resources for detection. As such the mathematical model will be a validated model that will be generally applicable for bioaerosols including pollen, pathogens and fungal spores. Detection of pollen will be carried out by supporting staff and projects using both traditional methods based on optical detection at the genus level and next generation sequencing at the species level. This proposal requires multidisciplinary approach to the problem as pollen appearance and behaviour in the air is dependent on many factors, including meteorological conditions, chemical composition of the atmosphere or surface properties as well as feedbacks between these elements. WRF-Chem currently used in air quality modelling will therefore be adapted for studying transport of bioaerosols in a way consistent with the transport and transformation of other air pollutants. Until now, no atmospheric model is used for the simulation of pollen at the species level in either Europe or in USA. Also, it will be the first time simulations of oak pollen will be possible in Europe or in USA. Also, it will be the first time simulations of oak pollen will be possible in Europe. Finally, it will be the first mathematical model that allows for a full feedback between meteorology, chemistry, bioaerosols and the terrestrial biosphere.
