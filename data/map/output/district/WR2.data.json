Our aim is to meet the demands of these diverse markets providing a high performance, low maintenance solution with reduced energy usage and superior operational performance which our extensive market research has validated a significant commercial interest in our objectives.\nEZ-Liner offers major advantages in trenchless relining for long runs of pipe in a single operation with associated reduced labour, reduced energy costs, reduced disruption and reduced time for pipe repairs. By utilising a thermoplastic liner, instead of traditional epoxy methods, the risk of contamination from such chemicals will be eliminated. The traditional methods are labour intensive and expensive, typically \u20ac300 to \u20ac350/m2. Our method will improve relining speed by 100% achieving a target cost of \u20ac230/m2 by minimising labour. By developing a novel liner delivery system that focuses the heating and consolidation of the pipe to a narrow band we aim to reduce energy consumption by at least15%. Uniquely our design will achieve consolidation, even in pipe work with surface defects.\nThe system will utilise a conformable thermoplastic liner drawn through the pipe by a novel consolidating head. This will clear debris in the pipe by water jets, form the liner in the pipe and consolidate with locally produced steam providing reduced energy usage and losses. Focusing steam into a localised area avoids escape into surroundings or damaged pipe, as is prevalent in traditional methods. The system we will deliver will be safer and more robust making it simpler to operate and easier to maintain; ideally suited for the harsh environment of the pipe relining market.\nThe system will be primarily validated in the drinking water pipe relining industry.

More than 2.6 billion cubic metres of drinkable water (30\u00a0% of the overall quantity) are wasted through leaks, which also represents an energy loss. In London alone, 890 million litres of water are lost each day through pipe cracks. Repairs are difficult, slow and costly, but European legislation on drinking water quality is forcing the need to find relevant solutions.\n\nWith EU support, the project 'Novel technology for low cost re-lining of pipe infrastructure' (http://www.ezline.info/ (EZ-LINE)) developed technology that eliminates the need to completely replace old pipes. As a trenchless technology, this system does not require excavation to rehabilitate pipes, but only access to the pipe ends.\n\nThe EZ-LINE solution is a low-cost system and does not incur any increase in the infrastructure cost. Furthermore, it has low-maintenance needs, reduced energy usage and superior operational performance.\n\nTo retrofit old pipes, the EZ-LINE system coats them with a thermoplastic liner from the inside. Compared to other trenchless rehabilitation methods, it does not have any harmful resins and is quick to install as well as ecologically sound, thus conforming to European standards. This conformable thermoplastic fabric is pulled through the pipe, pushed against the inner surface of the defective pipe, heated and consolidated by a novel pig-head design.\n\nDuring consolidation, the liner fabric partially melts to form a smooth, watertight solid sheet of reinforced plastic. Optionally, the liner can be braided with reinforcing fibres. This increases its burst strength, helping it to withstand high water pressures.\n\nConsortium members successfully demonstrated the EZ-LINE rehabilitation process at a partner institute. The relining process was carried out using prototype equipment at a speed of 6\u00a0metres per hour. This speed is expected to increase significantly when using commercial equipment with higher capacity.\n\nThe EZ-LINE system should serve both residential and municipal markets, ensuring continuing function of Europe's pipe networks. This innovative relining method could also be further developed to serve in the oil and gas sectors.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/149721.jpg", "fp7_96345_990997882"], ["6AJ", "Implementation of a dynamical Pollen Module and the transformations of the pollen including feedbacks in a numerical Weather Forecast Model", "University of Worcester", "The main goal of the proposed project is to provide an advanced mathematical model (WRF-BioChem) for modelling the emission, dispersion and concentration of bioaerosols at the regional scale. The model will with this development be able to handle feedback mechanisms between biology, chemistry and weather. The model is developed to go beyond state-of-the-art by developing the mathematical model for oak pollen and by doing it at the species level. The project supported by a three companion projects on grass pollen, fungal spores (Alternaria) and pathogens \u2013 all at species level. These projects deliver the needed resources for detection. As such the mathematical model will be a validated model that will be generally applicable for bioaerosols including pollen, pathogens and fungal spores. Detection of pollen will be carried out by supporting staff and projects using both traditional methods based on optical detection at the genus level and next generation sequencing at the species level. This proposal requires multidisciplinary approach to the problem as pollen appearance and behaviour in the air is dependent on many factors, including meteorological conditions, chemical composition of the atmosphere or surface properties as well as feedbacks between these elements. WRF-Chem currently used in air quality modelling will therefore be adapted for studying transport of bioaerosols in a way consistent with the transport and transformation of other air pollutants. Until now, no atmospheric model is used for the simulation of pollen at the species level in either Europe or in USA. Also, it will be the first time simulations of oak pollen will be possible in Europe or in USA. Also, it will be the first time simulations of oak pollen will be possible in Europe.

The mobility periods have several positive effects: enhancement of students\u2019 autonomous and entrepreneurial attitude, wider perspective for work, extended networks and improved language skills. International experiences enhance students\u2019 self-confidence, improve their problem solving skills and help them to recognize their own strengths and weaknesses and thus, they will be better prepared to work in multicultural environments. These skills ensure also better employability. This project makes a significant contribution for the vision of our VET institution which addresses the focus point of training competent professionals for the Helsinki metropolitan region, in Business Administration as well as in Information and Communication Technologies.\r\n\r\nWe want to ensure the international experiences also for those students who need encouragement and support on their studies. The international mobility period can be a remarkable experience which opens new opportunities for the students. Apart from the BA students, we want to pay special attention for the students in ICT in order to improve both their study motivation and courage. The purpose is to enhance their employability and to encourage to continue further their studies. \r\n\r\nStudents have both short and long on-the-job-learning periods and few of them have prolonged on-the-job-learning program which means the length of the mobility periods varies, but is at least 8 weeks long. Student exchange periods are 6 weeks long which is suitable for the German VET institutions using the dual system.  The exact time will be negotiated with the intermediary organizations beforehand. The partner VET institutions offer support for the student if needed. An on-the-job-learning instructor keeps contact with the work place and with the student and a Finnish teacher undertakes a guidance and monitoring visit to the on-the-job-learning placement during the mobility. At the same time, the teacher can search for new on-the-job-learning placements.  \r\n\r\nIn this project we broaden our partner network so that we can provide even more opportunities for our students and personnel to get acquainted with different cultures, working cultures and education systems. We have new partner schools or organizations in Italy, Poland, Malta and Sweden.  We will be offering the possibility of participating in international mobility for a larger target group as well, as we include also students and staff of Adult learning and recently graduated students.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of our international partners, we wish to learn new practices and teaching models. The project-based model is common in the current working life and therefore our objective is to develop the project-based learning model at teaching. \r\n\r\nStaff of our VET institution can participate in one week long job shadowing period at a partner VET institution. Teachers have also a possibility to participate in two weeks of teacher exchange. In this case, they will teach lessons in English at the partner VET institution according to their own competences at the same time as a partner teacher is respectively substituting their lessons in Finland. During the exchange period, teachers will follow, participate and discuss about the development of teaching, guidance, working life co-operation and teaching administration. The purpose of the teacher exchanges is to gain new ideas for teaching and development of other activities with mutual comparative analysis. If possible, teachers can combine the job shadowing period to the on-the-job-learning monitoring visits if there are students at the same destination. Students will benefit indirectly from the teachers\u2019 job shadowing periods and teacher exchanges because new teaching methods motivate and inspire students. In addition, teachers will gain a more positive attitude towards international affairs.\r\n\r\nThe objective of our VET institution is to increase the international activities according to our strategy. This project increases the reciprocal co-operation and develops both the sending and the receiving VET institution. After the mobility periods, participants will write a report which will be used with the future international co-operation and dissemination both inside and outside of the organization.
