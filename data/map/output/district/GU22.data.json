Our students have a low level of proficiency in languages, and even if they are trained in professional skills, they are not prepared for this transnational evolution. They are concerned about dealing in an unknown environment that will require them to adapt to the new situations.\r\n\r\nOur objectives:\r\n- Have our young Europeans follow a training course in a European Union country as part of their school curriculum;\r\n- Motivate our students, give them confidence and make them aware of the need to plan positively for the future;\r\n- Make the European citizenship concept grow in our young\u2019s mind;\r\n- Develop: knowledge (for passing the exam), skills and know-how (for successful integration into working life) and existential competences (for a smooth adaptation to social life).\r\n- Encourage exchanges and build a network of partners with businesses and schools;\r\n- Encourage further studies for our students in Europe;\r\n- Improve our students\u2019 employability.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of the participants:\r\n\r\n- 21 students from European section: a group of 5 students targeting Spain, a group of 4 targeting Portugal and a group of 12 students targeting English-speaking countries. Our specificity is to unite, in a single section, students preparing the 3 BTEC offered in our educational institution: Sales, Retail and Customers Relationship, that\u2019s why we set up cross-cutting projects.\r\n\r\nDescription of the activities:\r\n\r\nOur activities are spread throughout the total duration of the project:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Professional activities:\r\n- IN A EUROPEAN CONTEXT:\r\n- Introduce oneself; find out more about companies and their trade environment; characterize the customer reception procedures.\r\n- Welcome the clients and provide customer care, inform, advise, direct, and find out the needs of the client. Present a commercial offer; close the sale and make the customer want to come back .\r\n- Study a brand trade policy; identify recruiting procedures in Europe; applyfor a job, attend job interviews,  report on one\u2019s mobility abroad.\r\n- Study consumer\u2019s rights in the relevant European countries and the European institutions\r\n- Understand the concept and the impact of citizenship\r\n\u2022 Cultural activities:\r\n- Visit:\u201cla Maison Jean Monnet\u201d; theatrical play in English; eTwinning projects;  the Immigration Museum visit.\r\n- Study of the European institutions (visit of the European Parliament); the Europe Day Celebration; participation in the European Youth Parliament activities.\r\n- Cultural visits during the mobility.\r\n\r\nThe activities carried out enable to raise the student\u2019s awareness of the professional environment in a European context. In addition, cultural activities help to raise awareness of the European citizenship concept and develop their citizenship spirit at a European level. We have also chosen, in agreement with the education inspector, to make our students work on a topic directly related to the diplomas prepared and common denominator of the 3 BTEC frames of reference:  THE RIGHT OF CONSUMERS AND THE CITIZENSHIP in Spain,UK,Portugal and France.\r\nAll activities are managed with the assistance of the entire educational team (teachers and administrative staff) to develop common progressions and overall consistency in their implementation.\r\nImpact and expected results:\r\nThis project will allow students to discover that business practices are based on customs and lifestyles that differ according to countries. Mastering these cultural and professional aspects and foreign languages is not only the guarantee of a better professional insertion but also constitutes an additional factor to exam success. To encourage and motivate foreign language learning is a factor of employability and a way to fight against discrimination within the higher education curriculum. For our targeted public, the importance of developing this learning motivation through linguistic strengthening and cultural outings thus makes sense. Our goal is to create a network in order to create ties with other schools and companies to develop common work projects.\r\nPotential long-term benefits:\r\n- Sustainable transnational partnerships\r\n- Hiring from partner companies\r\n- Further studies abroad with partner institutions", "http://www.wsbhospices.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036614_3"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["7HS", "RA2", "WOKING COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"], ["7HS", "RDU", "WOKING COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"], ["7HS", "RTK", "WOKING COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"], ["7HS", "RVR", "WOKING HOSPITAL"], ["7HS", "RXX", "WOKING COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "GU22"}
