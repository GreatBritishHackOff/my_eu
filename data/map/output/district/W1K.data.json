The results will contribute to the discussion on how financial innovations could ignite a transition towards a greener economy and a more sustainable financial system.

Recent research portrays economic growth as a process of evolution of ecosystems of technologies and industrial capabilities.  This research has also shown a strong relationship between the development of the complexity of economies in a globalized market and overall output growth. ICT based tools, in particular complex systems analysis, simulation, systems science methods, and big data capabilities offer policymakers new opportunities to empirically map technology and capability ecosystems of countries and industrial sectors, analyse their structure, understand their dynamics, measure economic complexity, and design policy interventions more likely to have positive impacts on growth over time.  This project proposes to apply ICT tools in this way to yield insights on the industrial competitiveness and fragility of countries, the evolution of technologies and capabilities, the network of products, the adaptability of companies, and the ecology of E-commerce. In particular, E-commerce provides an important example of the active involvement of citizen in terms of their feedbacks on products and companies. The project will be a European and global collaboration amongst a network of researchers highly experienced in these topics. The teams involved represent an interdisciplinary consortium in which various research lines will be integrated in a network of collaborative effort to address challenging problems for a new vision of a data driven fundamental economics in a strongly connected, globalised world.

A better understanding of multi-level systems is essential for future ICT's and for improving life quality and security in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world. In this respect, complex networks science is particularly suitable for the many challenges that we face today, from critical infrastructures and communication systems, to techno-social and socio-economic networks.MULTIPLEX proposes a substantial paradigm shift for the development of a mathematical, computational and algorithmic framework for multi-level complex networks. Firstly, this will lead to a significant progress in the understanding and the prediction of complex multi-level systems.

For instance, each single root apex can simultaneously and continuously monitor many chemical and physical parameters. Natural organisms, including human beings, have often inspired works of science and science fiction on how to augment their abilities or interface them with machines. As a remarkable example, electroencephalography (EEG) enables the transduction of electrical activity in the brain into machine understandable signals of non-verbalised patterns.<br/>In this project, we plan to extend this approach to the realm of plants, shifting focus from interfacing a single entity (e.g. a human brain that controls a prosthetic device) to a network of entities (a community of plants) that renders an orchestrated response to the environment in which it lives. While artificial sensing devices exist that can monitor environmental parameters of interest, such as temperature or humidity, the focus of our research will be on the use of plants themselves as sensing and decision-making devices.<br/>The holistic approach we propose is novel: while plants as bio-sensors have been the object of previous studies, prior work has focused on the study of the sensing capabilities of individual plants in a controlled laboratory environment. In contrast, we plan to consider real field scenarios (e.g. a forest or a meadow) in which plants often receive uncontrollable and unpredictable stimuli. We will consider the case of multiple points of observations, in which readings from several plants are collected over a wireless network and integrated in a suitable way to obtain a consistent and global view of an environment of interest.

Substantial reduction of CO2 emissions can only be achieved by large scale deployment of renewable energy sources, including in particular the most abundant energy sources, wind and sun. Their intermittent nature however poses significant challenges for the energy system as peak demand from the system and peak production form those intermittent sources do not overlap. As there are no large scale storage solutions available yet, other backup capacities are needed. The installed fossil capacity is large enough to provide this back-up power. However, the plants were designed for baseload operation, which results in increased wear and costs through cyclic operation and unnecessarily high emissions in the start-up phase.\nProviding technology upgrades to retrofit the installed power plants to enable flexible operation without penalties on life, cost and emissions is an opportunity to quickly provide the necessary backup capacity to keep the energy system stable and resilient and at the same time enabling higher renewable shares.\nTURBO-REFLEX will follow this approach and has selected technologies for retrofitting critical parts of thermal power plants which have already seen experimental proof-of-concept and are expected to significantly contribute to flexible operation.
