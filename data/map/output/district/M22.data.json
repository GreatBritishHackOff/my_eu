When called to fight fires they can be exposed to high levels of heat stress, which results in decreased physical performance and even heat exhaustion. If a fire fighter succumbs to heat exhaustion he requires rescuing and this then exposes other fire fighters and the public to increased risk. In order to reduce the risk of heat stress, the firefighters are limited to the time they can be at the fire which increases the number of fire fighters needed to fight a fire and this reduces efficiency and introduces complication into the communications between the crews fighting the fire. The StayCool project will develop and prototype a novel system for cooling the body that is light weight, has low energy consumption and so can be worn for prolonged periods of time. Wearing the StayCool system will reduce the wearers core temperature and allow fire fighters to stay at the fire for greater periods of time and so improve the efficiency of fighting the fire, extinguishing the fire quicker and so reduce risk of loss of life and damage to property. The StayCool partnership is ideally placed to develop and exploit this technology having expertise in protective clothing design and manufacture, physiological and human factors testing, mathematical and thermodynamic modeling, access to rapid prototyping and manufacture facilities and the ability to design for manufacture to ensure the StayCool system can be fully exploited. The StayCool system is primarily aimed at a launch market for fire fighters but there e are a number of applications where humans need to work in high ambient temperatures. Additional markets for this technology and associated products include industrial plant operators, miners, underground maintenance, nuclear decommissioning, general policing in hot climates, policing in protective equipment and for use in extreme sports.", 324829.0, 1213210.0, "STAYCOOL", null, null, null, null, "http://www.eagletechnicalfabrics.com", null, "fp7_99604_984144444"], ["5TN", "Automated inspection for sintered parts by non-destructive techniques for improved quality in production", "Federal Mogul Sintered Products Limited", "'Sintered parts obtained by the powder metallurgy process are employed in several industry sectors, especially automotive. They are typically intricate, complex shaped parts produced in near net shape by compaction of powders into a geometry followed by sintering of the compacts for consolidation, where particles are bonded upon heating. The powder metallurgy process, by nature, is suited to high volume production and therefore any flaws/defects in the parts can have a significant impact on the production output for example loss of material and efficiency, as well as potential failures in use later. Therefore there is a need for automated inspection by non-destructive means, for determining and separating the good and bad batches during production, preferably as early as possible, without having to seek destructive examination carried out manually, which can have a negative impact on the production flow and output. More critically, any faulty part that is overlooked may cause more problems later on such as unexpected premature failures in application. Depending on the component and the criticality of the application this can have drastic consequences such as accidents.\n\nIn this project, we will develop a digital radiographic system for online inspection of powder metallurgy parts. This technique allows fast inspection and application of image processing for the detection of small cracks, flaws and density variations in-situ.'", null, 1236726.0, "AUTOINSPECT", "Automated inspection of sintered parts", "Non-destructive testing (NDT) is critical to the manufacture of high-quality components without the need to stop production or destroy components during evaluation. Producers of metal parts from powders now have this previously lacking capability.", "Powder metallurgy is used to manufacture solid metal parts from metal powders. The powders are compacted in a rigid toolset and then sintered or heated to bond the particles. The process produces high volumes of complex parts of near-net shape, meaning they are close to the final desired form and require minimal subsequent machining. The result is important savings in time, cost and materials' usage compared to conventional forming techniques.\n\nCurrently, defects or flaws are detected only through end-of-line destructive testing of a small number of parts. Late detection of flaws puts the realisation of benefits \u2014 and the competitive position of numerous small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \u2014 at risk. Further, implementation of defective parts in final products can pose significant safety hazards.\n\nWith increasing implementation in industries such as aerospace requiring 100\u00a0% inspection of parts, new inspection technology is desperately needed. EU-funded scientists working on the project http://www.autoinspectproject.eu/ (AUTOINSPECT) developed an automated in\u00a0situ digital radiographic NDT system. The low-cost solution enables real-time online inspection of both compacted and sintered parts. In addition, it is equally applicable to metal injection moulding (MIM), a version of powder metallurgy similar to plastic injection moulding.\n\nField trials have proven the capabilities of the AUTOINSPECT prototype and demonstrated that the technology has achieved a technology-readiness level of 4 to 6. Based on the tests, the team estimates 9 to 18 months of further development to deliver a fully integrated system to customers.\n\nAUTOINSPECT technology for in\u00a0situ NDT of powder metallurgy/MIM parts could increase the quality of numerous high-precision metal parts and the productivity and profitability of SMEs. Reducing material waste and product replacement costs will have further positive impact on the competitive position of EU manufacturers.", null, "http://www.federalmogul.com/en", "/docs/results/images/2015/153766.jpg", "fp7_100412_965604446"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["5WB", "STRONG & HERD LLP", 2835.0, "Other management expenditure (14.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_54360", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "M22"}
