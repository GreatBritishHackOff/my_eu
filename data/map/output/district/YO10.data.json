As APIs are biologically active compounds concerns have been raised about the potential effects of APIs in the environment on human and environmental health. Over the past 15 years, a substantial amount of work has been done to determine the occurrence, fate, effects, and resulting risks of APIs in the environment and regulatory schemes have been developed requiring environmental risk assessments of all new APIs. However for most APIs currently in use, limited data are available on environmental risks and for new APIs, the testing regimes may not always be optimum. The aim of this project therefore is to develop frameworks that utilise information from toxicological studies, pharmacological mode of action and in silico models to support more intelligent environmental testing of pharmaceuticals in development and to prioritise legacy pharmaceuticals for full environmental risk assessment and/or environmental (bio) monitoring. The aim will be delivered through a number of specific objectives: 1) to review existing approaches for prioritisation and mode of action based intelligent testing of APIs and develop improved frameworks; 2) to establish a high quality database on the properties, environmental fate characteristics and ecotoxicity of APIs; 3) to develop methods for estimating external and internal exposure to APIs for different scenarios; 4) to develop methods and models for predicting ecotoxicological responses to APIs; 5) to validate the developed models, concepts and frameworks using targeted experiments; and 6) to develop a software system to support intelligent testing and prioritisation of APIs in the environment.

However, considerable technological advances in platform reliability and endurance are required, to potentiate the wide-spread deployment and usage of MRS for environmental monitoring.\n\nFault tolerance is one of the most prominent challenges in the field of MRS. Efficient and long term operation of a MRS requires an accurate and timely detection, and accommodation of abnormally behaving robots.

Most existing fault tolerant systems prescribe a characterization of the normal robot behaviors, and train the fault-detection model to recognize these behaviors. Behaviors not recognized by the model are consequently labelled abnormal or faulty. However, these models assume a priori knowledge of normal behavior.

Molluscs were exploited as a food resource and shells were used as personal ornaments, providing some of the earliest evidence of symbolic thinking displayed by early humans. These appear between 160-70 ka ago, a period which falls tantalisingly outside that of many commonly applied dating techniques.

By applying a novel (closed-system) method of AAR dating, mAARiTIME will build chronological frameworks able to provide reliable dating control for this area.

Those systems are also called dependable systems, as our lives can depend on them. Examples are controllers in an airplane, breaking controller in a car, or a train control system. Those safety-critical systems need to be certified and the maximum execution time needs to be bounded and known so that response times can be assured when critical actions are needed. Even with high performance processors in our desktop PCs we notice once in a while that the PC is 'frozen' for a few seconds. For a safety-critical system such a 'pause' can result in a catastrophic failure.The mission of T-CREST is to develop tools and build a system that prevents pauses by identifying and addressing the causes for possible pauses. The T-CREST time-predictable system will simplify the safety argument with respect to maximum execution time striving to double performance for 4 cores and to be 4 times faster for 16 cores than a standard processor in the same technology (e.g., FPGA). Thus the T-CREST system will result in lower costs for safety relevant applications reducing system complexity and at the same time faster time-predictable execution.Standard computer architecture is driven by the following paradigm: make the common case fast and the uncommon case correct. This design approach leads to architectures where the average-case execution time is optimized at the expense of the worst-case execution time (WCET). Modelling the dynamic features of current processors, memories, and interconnects for WCET analysis often results in computationally infeasible problems. The bounds calculated by the analysis are thus overly conservative.We need a sea change and we shall take the constructive approach by designing computer architectures where predictable timing is a first-order design factor.

It is anticipated that developments in the field of energy use in offices will lead to its reduction through various strategies, including comfort/health standards and ventilation levels. In such a context and given the technological evolution of the functions and services accomplished in offices, it is time to address the issue of IAQ in offices. The participants of this proposal are fully aware of the issues described above and, particularly, of the difficulties to launch solid policies on IAQ, both generally and specifically in offices, related simultaneously to ventilation, energy and health. The uncertainties that justify those difficulties are derived from the lack of information regarding the toxicity of a number of compounds that pollute indoor air. Furthermore, the lack of knowledge of their indoor concentrations and exposures in the current conditions means that the real impact of these compounds on IAQ, comfort/ health and productivity in offices is unknown.

Sixty-five of 400 potsherds suitable for examination were analysed.\n\nThe samples of pottery found near the coast clearly made sense as they supported the notion of vessels being used to carry seafood. Shards found inland needed several types of analyses and showed both coastal and inland site residues of marine or freshwater origins.

This stage involved study of 12 European countries to identify commonalities and differences in objectives, examining issues such as patient classification, DRG weight calculation and hospital payments.\n\nDuring the second phase the EuroDRG team explored and compared the classification mechanisms of national DRG systems for 10 specific patient groups and conditions (e.g. hip replacement, breast cancer, stroke). The results of these analyses were published in high ranked medical journals. Moreover, EuroDRG researchers compared the performance of DRG systems for the predefined patient groups across European countries and their ability to define homogenous groups of patients so that reimbursement is fair. The team collected patient-level data and specific classification variables used by different DRG systems, looking at how these systems explain variations in resource consumption.

We propose to tackle specific key questions about the fate of carbon in forests by taking advantage of existing afforestation experiments in England (main phase) and in Russian Siberia (return phase), by combining new stable isotopes methods and innovative in-growth core approaches. We will enrich tree canopies with 13C-CO2 and track changes in isotopic composition of CO2 evolved from soil using a unique mobile mass-spectrometry lab, available only at the University of York, England. We shall also monitor CH4 fluxes with parallel determination of 13C in CH4. This would allow estimating the gross rates of CH4 production and consumption and for a first time discern the role of fine roots and soil fungi in mediating CH4 flux. Furthermore, the application of N will mimic elevated N deposition, an important global change factor, to predict the response of soil carbon cycle in forests to global climate change. During the return phase we will apply the developed in England in-growth cores to a unique Siberian afforestation experiment, examining the effect of six dominant Siberian tree species on the roles of mycorrhiza and fine roots in carbon fluxes. Overall, the project would 1) greatly advance our knowledge of soil C cycling in forest ecosystems and 2) establish a new cooperative link between researchers of the Institute of Forest in Krasnoyarsk and the University of York", 202319.0, 202319.0, "NITFOR", null, null, null, null, "http://www.york.ac.uk", null, "fp7_88582_999978336"], ["5DD", "Vesicular protein sorting in the Golgi apparatus", "University of York", "The correct sorting of proteins is an important challenge for all eukaryotic cells. Problems in protein sorting are known to lead to various developmental defects or acquired diseases in humans. In the secretory pathway, whose main sorting hub is the Golgi apparatus, vesicular transport is used to sort proteins. To maintain the unique composition of different Golgi cisternae for example, resident Golgi-enzymes are continuously sorted away from their substrates, the secreted proteins. This is mostly mediated by COPI dependent retrograde vesicle transport, during which vesicles of different compositions are targeted to the various cisternae. The COG complex, several Rab GTPases and golgins, all function during the process referred to as vesicle tethering, to mediate the targeting of COPI vesicles. The molecular details of vesicle tethering, which is an essential process during every vesicle transport step, are unknown. It is believed to be the first encounter between vesicle and target membrane, and to encompass a series of protein-protein interactions leading to membrane fusion. This proposal aims to determine the interaction-topology of the involved proteins, and the identities of hitherto unknown factors, to establish a molecular mechanism of vesicle tethering at the Golgi. For this purpose we will use a combination of biochemical and genetic methods. Using in vivo immunoprecipitations and in vitro interaction assays we will reveal the interaction map of tethering. To uncover novel factors involved in the process we will take advantage of the known glycan processing defects associated with COG deficiencies.

Knowledge and control of these transformative technologies is frequently seen as a cornerstone in the early acquisition of material wealth, physical might and symbolic authority.\n\nHowever, the intensification of iron production is also often attributed with triggering pronounced ecological deterioration, whether in the forests of Europe, Asia, the Americas or Africa, due to an increased need for fuel and a subsequent over-exploitation of wood resources. Despite the frequency with which this argument is referenced, it is a hypothesis that remains to be systematically tested. Yet the importance of developing a firm understanding of this relationship is not to be overlooked. Through an exploration of the links between past industries and historical environmental change, more coherent strategies for resilient resource exploitation in the present can be developed, in Africa and elsewhere.\n\nAn archaeological study of iron production in the Pare Mountains, Tanzania presents an excellent opportunity to do just this. Within a defined research area, the fuel needs of an emergent iron industry can be quantified and mapped through time.

For a long time, and until the emergence of the merino wool from Spain, the finest wools were exported from England. Changes in the types and qualities of wool available at different periods in different regions have been plotted both by archaeologists working on the excavated textiles and by historians researching documentary sources. Archaeologists have been using the distribution of fibre diameters to classify medieval wool into fleece types, but this analysis can barely describe the 50 or more wool grades found in historical records. This analysis is made even more complicated by the processing of wool and by the archaeological context that affect the physical and chemical properties of the fibres. The purpose of the proposal is to develop new proteomics based tools to study ancient wools. Proteomics attempts both qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the protein composition of the wool fibres themselves.

An alternative approach is Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording  in which a laser is used to heat the medium to a sufficiently high temperature to assure writability using currently available write head fields. Also a new, highly promising, development is that of spin electronics in which the spin of the electron rather than merely the charge forms the basis of the device operation. This holds the prospect of allowing technology to develop beyond the limits of miniaturisation of standard electronics and may yield the solution of the increasing power requirements for conventional electronic devices. However, the switching speeds are limited by precessional motion of the magnetic spins to hundreds of picoseconds. However, magnetic spins can be manipulated on the femtosecond timescale.  However, the physics of the processes occurring on this timescale is poorly understood. The proposal aims to develop a multiscale approach to the theoretical understanding of femtosecond magnetisation processes and to make a critical comparison with experimental data.

Models covering a variety of timescales are necessary to support development of related devices. To access the timescale of photons, electrons and spin interactions, one requires time-dependent density function theory (DFT). On the other hand, to compare model outputs to experimental results, one requires mesoscopic continuum models.\n\nFEMTOSPIN is passing information from DFT to the mesoscopic model using atomistic spin models. Experimental work is used to fine-tune models and provide greater insight.\n\nDFT electronic structure calculations are now providing insight into the mechanisms and properties underlying ultrafast magnetisation dynamics. In particular, models are illuminating the role of spin transport in magnetisation changes following application of a laser pulse. Electronic structure calculations are then linked mathematically to classical atomistic spin models. Together, these feed into the large-scale macrospin models that form an important link to experiments.\n\nModels have shed light on numerous related phenomena. Partners' discovery of thermally induced magnetisation switching (switching by a heat pulse alone without an applied magnetic field) prior to initiation of the project sparked worldwide attention. Now, the team has found the apparent origin of the effect. Further, the models predict such heat-driven reversal to take place in synthetic ferrimagnets consisting of two ferromagnetic layers coupled antiferromagnetically.

Previous investigations both into the pre-history and contemporary impacts of whaling have been hampered by difficulties in accurately identifying fragmentary archaeological whale bones.

Both methods were to be convenient and low cost, and applied to study of whale species ecology and hunting patterns over the last 4\u00a0000 years. The single-member project ran for two years to September 2014.\n\nWork began with testing a new ZooMS protocol, comparing collagen peptide fingerprints against known samples. Following training, project researchers refined the ZooMS technique by comparing whale collagen remains against known museum specimens. The results were combined with recently published data to create a whale collagen database, hence verified against archaeological whale remains. Comparison of ZooMS against DNA techniques established that ZooMS consistently yielded accurate identification to family or genus level, but could not discriminate closely related species.\n\nComparison of ZooMS and DNA microsampling approaches showed that the former did not consistently yield sufficient collagen for unambiguous identification. However, the DNA technique could reliably identify species using samples as small as 3\u00a0mg. The microsampling technique was successfully demonstrated using a 1\u00a0000-year-old bone artefact.\n\nCertain samples could not be identified morphologically but were identifiable using the project's techniques.

The collagen proved to be the key to identifying species used to make the parchment. The simple procedure requires no specialist training and puts the sampling in the hands of those comfortable with these materials (conservators and curators).\n\nBecause the methodology is safe for old documents, the team had unprecedented access to libraries and archives.

The damage is related to the quality and method of production of the parchment, or the time exposed to lime for dehairing.

Transduction of the auxin stimulus depends on selective protein degradation: it involves the activity of the TIR1 family receptors, that act in the SCF complex to target the family of Aux/IAA transcription factors for degradation. Although the core module of auxin signalling has been established, the mechanisms that modulate the signal flow are still only partially understood. A genetic screen performed in the host laboratory identified the advoluta (adv) mutant, which exhibits increased apical dominance and hyponastic leaves, suggesting an impaired auxin response.  Moreover, preliminary analysis points to a complex genetic interaction between adv and the auxin response mutant axr1. Together this implies that ADV could be a novel component in auxin signalling. The objectives of this study are the characterisation of adv in the context of its putative involvement in the auxin signalling cascade, cloning of the adv mutation and the functional molecular analysis of the gene product. A wide set of modern techniques ranging from genetics and molecular biology to plant physiology and biochemistry will be employed in the project, including various specialised methods to asses auxin response.

According to this view, the objects to be classified are represented in terms of properties that are intrinsic to the object itself. Hence, a typical pattern recognition system makes its decisions by simply looking at one or more feature vectors provided as input. The strength of this approach is that it can leverage a wide range of mathematical tools ranging from statistics, to geometry, to optimization.  However, in many real-world applications a feasible feature-based description of objects might be difficult to obtain or inefficient for learning purposes. In these cases, it is often possible to obtain a measure of the (dis)similarity of the objects to be classified, and in some applications the use of dissimilarities (rather than features) makes the problem more viable. In the last few years, researchers in pattern recognition and machine learning are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of similarity information per se. Indeed, by abandoning the realm of vectorial representations one is confronted with the challenging problem of dealing with (dis)similarities that do not necessarily obey the requirements of a metric. This undermines the very foundations of traditional pattern recognition theories and algorithms, and poses totally new theoretical and computational questions. In this project we aim at undertaking a thorough study of several aspects of purely similarity-based pattern analysis and recognition methods, from the theoretical, computational, and applicative perspective.

In Sothern Europe, there is good archaeological evidence for cereal cultivation and animal husbandry between 9,000 to 7,000 years ago; practices that can be traced to their origin in the Near East over a millennia earlier.

Did farming arrive as a complete package or were some elements introduced earlier than others? Was this process driven by the movement of people or of ideas?   Recent methodological advances in molecular biology and mass spectrometry have provided new analytical tools that are now available to address these questions. Stable isotope analysis of human bones and chemical analysis of food remains on archaeological artefacts have provided spectacular insights into changes in human diets and subsistence practices.

Singularity theorems, developed over the past 50 years following pioneering work of Penrose and Hawking, are mathematically rigorous results that imply that singularities are inevitable provided the matter content of the universe obeys a suitable energy conditions. Although forms of matter described by quantum field theory can violate the original energy conditions, recent developments provide hope that singularity theorems can be proved even in this case. To date, however, no known singularity theorem fully corresponds to the behaviour of quantum fields or takes into account the backreaction of the quantum field on the spacetime. The goal of this project is to establish singularity theorems for quantised matter using recent work by the researcher and the supervisor as a base.

To balance the requirements for data consistency and availability, organisations increasingly migrate towards hybrid data persistence architectures comprising both relational and NoSQL databases. The consensus is that this trend will only become stronger in the future; critical data will continue to be stored in ACID (predominately relational) databases while non-critical data will be progressively migrated to high-availability NoSQL databases.

Aiming to meet and surpass the requirements set for the 5G-and-Beyond mobile data network, in SPOTLIGHT we will create a fully-integrated and multi-disciplinary network of Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) that will analyze, design, and optimize the performance of a disruptive new mobile network architecture: the SPOTLIGHT architecture. This architecture promises to break performance limitations present to the currently loosely inter-connected, resource-fragmented and isolated in operation mobile network ecosystem, by transforming the currently loosely-coupled multitude of heterogeneous and multi-layered RATs to a flat coalition of massively distributed antenna sub-systems that are optimally orchestrated by a cloud-empowered network core. Our primary aim will be to support for the first time self-including yet ultra-reliable radio communications at the edge network.

With fish resources under increasing pressure, accurate, cumulative histories of anthropogenic and environmental change are a key tool in developing effective management policies. Archaeology can help overcome this issue by providing detailed, long-range histories of local inshore fisheries and their exploitation by humans, but only if techniques for the identification and analysis of fishbone are refined. Fishbones are underrepresented in the archaeological literature because they are less stable than other taxa. Identification to species is often difficult or impossible. During my MSc I developed an identification system for fishbone: ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry), based upon protein barcoding. As proteins can be cleaved enzymatically and analyzed by mass spectrometry in a repeatable way, protein barcoding is used widely for quick and inexpensive protein identification. Mass spectra reflect the differences in protein sequence and can therefore be reproducibly linked to a particular protein or fragment. Since I left the lab, this method for fish identification has stalled, despite earnest requests from the community for a robust method. ZooMS uses peptide fingerprinting of collagen as a method for rapid identification of archaeological bone. Identifying masses to peptides of known sequence is required. For mammals, sufficient sequence information is available, but, for freshwater fish, species are highly diverse and few sequences are available. This project will develop biomolecular techniques to overcome these hurdles, creating a database of fish collagen sequences and testing the method at several archaeological sites.
