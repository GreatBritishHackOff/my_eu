Many different developments mean that the European and international markets continues to \r\ngrow together. In the future, more and more small and medium-sized companies are required to act in the international / European \r\nmarket.To obtain these competencies as an educational institution at this level or rather develop, measures are to be planed and \r\nconducted in medium- and long-term; measures to increase employee skills (social, technical, methodological, language skills, etc.) \r\nin their own companies and foreign companies, wishing to acquire international experience in the learning mobility. Trainees from the commercial sectors need for their daily dealings with customers increasingly knowledge of foreign languages, \r\nintercultural skills and a particularly high mobility readiness. Both from the perspective of companies which are active in \r\ninternational markets, as well as from the professional perspective of trainees, the need arises to acquire these skills. \r\nIn this two-year project 105 trainees in total from the companies described above (increased from rural areas) should be mediated in \r\nappropriate internships directly or through our partner organizations. As in the former project we want to give apprentices to disabled persons (in total 5, two apprentice for seriously disabled person). \r\nParticipants receive their scholarship after receiving their application documents and having an interview with \r\nthem. In collaboration with partner organizations in the target countries suitable placements are searched, stays at the destination organized and support ensured. The trainees are supervised in the placement companies of training managers who accompany the content and technical progress of trainees and evaluate it. The students continue their record books during the internship  and at the end of their stay abroad they create a final report that is used for the evaluation and dissemination of project results. After the return of the participants they will write a final report and judge their stay abroad in a feedback session with the Academy of Economics. \r\nDuring the implementation of the activities, the Academy of Economics uses a project management tool to plan and control the following steps described before: Application - Selection and Information - Preparation - Implementation - Monitoring - Evaluation. This leads to a target-oriented project management which integrates measures for unforeseen situations and quality assurance. The financial management of project funds will be managed by the Academy of Economics Schleswig-Holstein, which is set up for \r\nthis purpose a particular cost unit. The payment of project funds takes place by the Academy of Economics Schleswig-Holstein. \r\nThe software systems provided by the managing national and European authorities of the ERASMUS+ program for accounting of the \r\nproject, participants registration and maintenance, reporting, Europass-CV and Europass mobility are used during the \r\nimplementation of the project. \r\nTrainees of companies should improve their own linguistic, social, intercultural and technical skills to the effect \r\ncompared to Europe, to be more open and to be more internationalize in thinking and acting. The impact on the daily work will \r\nresult into the fact that companies will focus even more international, remain competitive and develop common standards to act Europe-wide.

This formal, non-formal and work based training, triggers positive changes in terms of self-esteem, language skills, flexibility and organizational skills.\r\n\r\nThe project tackles the reduction of  young people being unemployment and gives the participants entrepreneurial skills increasingly required by the labour market and to obtain a qualified job and the understanding of continuous learning.\r\nThis project will improve, strengthen and expand the skills and competences acquired in theory, with a work-placement of 22 days in a company in England or Spain. Whiles being abroad on a mobility they  will improve their language skills and understand new ways to make them more flexible, open-minded and open towards innovation and modernisation. The training will start in Italy, with a preparatory stage where the participant obtains competences on how to present yourself in an interview, some coaching on addressing difficult situations and some communication techniques to better deal with their experience abroad.

The main aim of the project is to offer large-scale education to meet the needs of the labour market in the European Union and to support people involved in vocational education by offering them knowledge, vocational skills and a qualification that is recognized by ECVET and/or Europass. \r\nDuring the period of 1st September 2017 to 31st August 2018, in total 23 students will be involved in work placements in Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Sweden, Germany and Italy. Students involved are studying one of these specialties: car technician, cleaning services, household economy, cooks, cook's helper, building and road construction, IT specialist, customer service assistant for logistics\u2019 companies, agricultural producer, equine management and veterinary assistance. Staff mobility includes 4 staff members (head teachers and the management) and 10 professional teachers. The aim of staff mobility is to introduce different teaching methodologies and tools, also to widen their knowledge so that it would lead to appropriate changes in our respective curricula. We hope that it would help teachers to generate new ideas on how to integrate different subjects in order to improve the teaching quality, so that the learner would be more motivated to learn, and that the knowledge would help them in the future life. The involvement of different methods and ICT tools help to teach how to solve vital problems and face challenges, and as a results of this, students are more enterprising, more willing to generate ideas and look for new solutions, able to set goals and achieve them, and are more responsible. \r\nIn addition, we value life-long learning key competences: developing foreign language skills, motivating participants to study other foreign languages and gaining an interest in foreign cultures, teaching both students and teachers\u2019 self-confidence and initiative. The project activities offer opportunities to broaden their mind by learning more about foreign traditions, cultures, technologies and work-specifics vocational skills. \r\nIn the mobility project, we prefer to include students from the second and third year, because they have already gained knowledge and professional skills and have some work experience. Nevertheless, application requirements are the same for every student, and the opening will be announced via the school website and social media.\r\nAll the participants will be offered full support by both sending organization and hosting organizations before and during the mobility.

The professional experience helps students adapt to new working environments and working teams. \r\nStudents entering the labour market straight from the schools tend to be more insecure, have less courage and less (diverse) practice. We believe that work placements abroad and foreign experience makes young people more privileged than their classmates, also proves their courage and initiative to achieve more. Entering the labour market right after graduating from school often leaves the students in a weaker position because of a lack of real work experience.

It is possible to save energy by using the lighting method through intelligent running lights (in the right place at the right time and by providing light levels)\r\n\r\nLighting management technologies relies on the device can be used to apply a special strategy and the methods to manage these devices. In particular, these use infrared, ultrasonic, dual technology sensors, time switches, dimmers and efficient luminaries technology. Managing these technologies jointly  automation systems are used.\r\n\r\nFor being close to the industrial area Silivri has been acting as subcontracting for large companies and international firms in electrical installation works. Silivri had to reject many lighting companies\u2019 subcontracting jobs due to the problem of skilled workers. Companies have been facing with the problem of qualified staff. This is because, our apprentices, who work at lighting companies, receiving trainings in the vocational training centers. They have been receiving the training only about simple electrical wiring circuits, due to lack of teachers, laboratory and curriculum at these training centers.\r\nNo education has been provided related to special lighting installation. Hence, our students are not familiar to the equipment used in special lighting installation and they are not able to get any knowledge on the automation systems. Whereas, our apprentices who are trained in the vocational training center do their jobs for life. They do not to tend to another job. The centers where our apprentices have been trained are the vocational training centers. They will not receive any more education from any institutions after graduating their schools. Therefore, the education they obtained at the vocational training centers determines their qualifications for life. The project training will have the opportunity to improve the quality of apprentices. They will lifelong use the knowledge received on lighting automation under the project.\r\n\r\nOur participants in the project will consist of 18 students of Silivri vocational training center. Our participants perform a 4 day apprenticeship at workplaces and study a day at our center. Therefore, our participants develop their skills by practicing and experiencing. Hence, during their oversea training the implementation will be performed at Dudley College\u2019s workplaces for 2 days and job shadowing training will be made in Dudley college\u2019s contracted workplaces.\r\n\r\nThe project comprises the students of electric electronics technology field of Silivri Vocational Training Centre. They will be receiving their abroad trainings at Dudley College vocational training center. The trainings will be realized as practicing and job shadowing training. \r\n\r\nThe abroad training will take 4 weeks and will be held between 25.02.2018  and 24.03.2018.\r\n\r\nThrough the project 18 vocational training center\u2019s students will be taking the practicing training on special lighting systems at the vocational educational institution of Dudley College. Their qualifications on special lighting systems will be enhanced at the end of their trainings and they will be educated as the qualified personnel companies look for. Our companies will receive the contracted job offers related to special lighting systems.\r\n\r\nProject achievements of our participants will be as follows.\r\n1. They will learn general information on automation systems and usage in lighting,\r\n2. They will learn the SCR automation system,\r\n3. They will learn infrared, ultrasonic and the lighting management with dual sensor technology,\r\n4. They will learn dimming control systems with control panels for lighting,\r\n5. They will control techniques of wireless lighting,\r\n6. They will recognize energy-saving fixtures used in interior lighting,\r\n7. They will learn to connect the system to the lighting control panel,\r\n8. They will be informed about lighting control systems on the purpose,\r\n9.  English language skill of the participants will be enhanced, \r\n10. Our participants will develop multicultural communicate skills,\r\n11. They will learn to use ICT technologies,\r\n12. They will learn Europe work disciplines and will be an example to other employees,\r\n13.
