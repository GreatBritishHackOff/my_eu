The objective is to develop a safety system which will detect and provide early warning about a number of conditions that can pose a danger to those underground. It will be based on low cost and low consumption communication technology, which offers robust conditions in front of electromagnetic disturbances. The basic system will include a number of nodes along the underground space, located in the upper limits of the walls (Static Nodes). The different nodes have to be situated sight-to-sight with at least 2 nodes, accomplishing the\ncommunication channel. Visitors will wear specifically designed nodes (mobile nodes), which will communicate with static nodes.\nThe system will include the following characteristics and capabilities: i) Only power wire is needed, in order to power supply to wall routers; ii) Low maintenance cost; iii) Low cost; iv) Robustness: IP compliant for hazardous ambient; v) Static node sensing of temperature, humidity, light, pressure, sound and gas (O, CO, CO2) sensing capabilities; vi) specialized static nodes for vibration sensing and landslide detection vii) mobile nodes.'", 113395.0, 1143247.0, "UNDERSAFE", "Safer below-ground tourism", "An EU-study assessed safety in European underground tourist attractions. The solution is a safety monitoring system, consisting of sensors and transmitter nodes, providing visitors with safety updates.", " Today, there are more than 3\u00a0600 underground tourist attractions worldwide, more than half being in Europe. A tailored technological safety monitoring system for underground tourist attractions may help improve safety and risk monitoring. The EU-funded project http://www.undersafe.eu (UNDERSAFE), a nine-member consortium, aimed to develop such a system. The technology was intended to be easy to use and maintain, and also to automatically and continuously monitor safety and environmental conditions. The project concluded in September 2013 after two years.\n\nThe study team began with surveying the needs of more than 800 potential users. The data were used to characterise the types of activities and visitors that such attractions host. The information also provided a basis for hazard analysis, including the kinds of accidents that have occurred. The project concluded that no country has specific rules for underground activities, and that pan-European regulations should exist.\n\nBased on the survey, UNDERSAFE successfully developed a system based on RFID and Zig Bee wireless communication technologies. The system consists of access point (AP) modules located at the tops of walls, including sensors monitoring the underground environment and nearby vibrations, in addition to other sensors. Visitors wear additional nodes, which communicate with the stationary AP modules, and receive information from them.\n\nThe system further includes a long list of additional components or sub-systems, either developed or customised by the study group. Examples include mobile RFID tags, various sensor elements, plus software components such as a database, an expert system and various processing algorithms. Additional software work included sophisticated management interfaces and communication sub-systems.\n\nUNDERSAFE developed a system that improves safety monitoring and alerts in underground tourism settings. The system also offers economic benefits to European tourism and European small businesses.", null, "http://www.interkonsult.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/149392.jpg", "fp7_100443_964804390"], ["7NB", "Development of an efficient heating and cooling technology system for rotational moulding, which will \u2013dramatically reduce cycle time, product cost and energy consumption", "Trent Mouldings Limited", "Rotational Molding is a very competitive manufacturing method for producing large hollow plastic products. It provides one advantage over other plastic processing technologies: production of seamless articles, with uniform wall thickness and complex shapes for sectors as chemical storage, toys, construction and transports. However this technology has stuck without major innovative improvements in last years becoming energy inefficient and costly, and at the same time other techniques which have substantially improved (as injection moulding or blowing moulding) are not suitable for such large pieces. Moreover, it has to face up to the growing market of low cost plastic goods from China and India. As a result, rotational moulding industry with high labour and energy costs becomes one of the most vulnerable sectors of Plastic Processing Industry. Therefore, this sector needs to research and develop technology innovations in order to provide plastic industry of high value added products which manufacturing will allow it to reduce energy consumption and production costs. The challenge is the development of low energy systems in order to enhance the energy efficiency and reduce the cycle time, without becoming more expensive. The solution proposed is an automatic rotational molding machine with the following systems: -Induction Heating System. This system will use a medium frequency power supply and helical induction coils to generate heat within the mold. It will integrate a thermal insulating layer between the coil and the mold to avoid heat losses. -Internal Cooling System. The new technology will be integrated an internal cooling system which it will consist of ionic liquids. This system will remove heat from internal mould atmosphere, reducing the cooling time. In addition, it will provide low pressure to the polymer when it has reached melt point in order to improve the mechanical properties of the final product and to reduce cycle times.", 271287.0, 2264090.0, "ROTOFAST", "Breaking the mould in plastic design", "Compared with other moulding techniques, rotational moulding is regarded as a slow process since no external pressure is applied to mould the products. EU-funded scientists are developing a cutting-edge rotomoulding machine that is energy efficient and produces plastic parts at a considerably faster rate.", "Rotational moulding is a manufacturing method for producing custom plastic products, especially hollow plastic designs. Although this process allows large and even-walled durable plastic pieces to be formed at virtually no pressure, it is energy intensive and requires a long manufacturing time.\n\nThis technology faces intense competition from a growing market of goods from low-cost\u2013labour countries. To enhance European competitiveness in the rotational moulding sector, scientists in the http://www.rotofast.eu/ (ROTOFAST) project are focused on reducing cycle time, energy consumption and product cost. For this reason, they are developing a novel rotomoulding machine with advanced heating and cooling technology.\n\nTo get homogeneous heat over the mould surface, the project team developed a mould made of multiple layers from different thermal insulation materials. This allowed decrease in heat losses by approximately 80\u00a0% compared to conventional radiant ovens.\n\nThe automatic rotomoulding machine incorporates an induction heating system that optimises energy generation, resulting in 70\u00a0% less energy consumption for each manufactured unit. Furthermore, the system heats the mould tool cavity, getting a homogeneous polymer in 30\u00a0% less time.\n\nThe prototype unit also includes an internal cooling system that is based on ionic liquids. This reduces cooling cycling time by 20\u00a0% compared to conventional cooling processes. By cooling external surfaces and the internal cavity through a closed loop design, it avoids any liquid losses.\n\nFinally, a rapid prototype protocol was developed to improve the quality of design. Using a computer-aided design file, it simulates electromagnetic fields in the system, induced heating, temperature distribution in the mould, and heat exchange between the mould and the polymer.\n\nROTOFAST is helping the future development of faster and more efficient moulding machines for plastics. The lower costs will also benefit consumers.", null, "http://www.rototek.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112729.jpg", "fp7_95349_957620182"], ["5DJ", "Increasing yield on Tungsten and Tantalum ore production by means of advanced and flexible control on crushing, milling and separation process", "Interkonsult Ltd", "Modern economy is highly dependent on specific raw materials, and it is envisaged that this dependency will increase in the near future. Most of them are scarce in EU and of poor purity, being mixed within complex and low grade aggregates which need to be processed by means of a separation process consuming high quantities of energy and water, and even in some cases this makes its exploitation unfeasible due to production costs. \nBeing EU dependent on some of these materials, as identified by EIP initiative, our society is demanding more efficient extracting processes to contribute to major European independency on these Critical Raw Materials.\nTungsten and Tantalum ores are two recognized CRMs: In a market currently dominated by China and Russia production (among others), in Europe Tungsten (limited) production is mostly concentrate into UK, Spain and Portugal . On the other side, Tantalum is a key element on electronics with clear EU external production dependency, as it is naturally really scarce in Europe (only 1% of world production is concentrated in EU). \nKnowing this situation, OptimOre Project proposes the research and development of modelling and control technologies, using advanced sensing and advanced industrial control by means of artificial intelligence techniques, for the more efficient and flexible Tantalum and Tungsten ores processing from crushing to separation process, with the participation of relevant international players in the mining field on research (Chalmers University- Dr. Magnus Evertsson, Exeter University with Dr. Richard Pascoe, Freiburg University with Dr. Holberg Lieberwirth, among others).
