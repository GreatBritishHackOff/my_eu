It will also provide significant environmental benefits, through conservation of non-renewable raw materials, processing energy, and CO2 emissions, and a reduction in landfill use. The lack of highly efficient separation processes for consumer plastics results in materials that are contaminated and inconsistent regarding physical properties. This results in two distinct problems in the processing of these materials by extrusion methods. The first is the presence of small particulate contaminants, which can give rise to serious defects and the generation of scrap product. The second is batch-to-batch variability in the bulk melt flow index, due to differences in the source of the waste materials used.

Due to the very large radar cross section of the turbines and the motion of the rotating blades, these turbines have a detrimental effect on civilian radar navigations systems and there is growing concern about the potential problems which wind turbines may have on passenger safety. Due to space limitations, wind turbines are increasingly being located in areas close to the main shipping lanes and aviation flight paths and wind farm planning applications are increasingly being rejected. As a result of the radar interference issues, wind energy companies are desperately looking for a solution. Although both electronic radar solutions and the use of Radar Absorbing Materials (RAMs) coated onto the turbines have been considered, no cost-effective solution has as yet been produced.

Agricultural plastic film waste has proven difficult to recycle commercially due to the high levels of contamination and its wide geographical dispersion which lead to high transport costs. This means that recycling schemes require financial support from governments and/or must charge high fees in order to be financially sustainable. Hence many farmers use alternative, environmentally harmful, disposal methods, such as burning or land-filling, which do not take advantage of the latent value of recyclates and do not comply with current and future legislation.

The purpose was to assess soilage removal, and the project tested airflow in those terms. The work revealed a large variability in soilage quantity, which was determined to require three different methods of collection and processing depending on the amount.\n\nInstead, the team developed a method of processing the film as a flat sheet collected directly from the field.

Considering that domestic heating and hot water provision accounts for nearly 40% of total energy demand it is clearly desirable to increase market penetration of renewable heating systems. On a domestic scale solar thermal systems are increasingly common and are, to the general public, the most visible renewable energy technology. Moreover, compared to biomass they have distinct user benefits when it comes to domestic heating or hot water provision as they do not need physical feedstock. However, despite significant market growth their market penetration only accounts for 0.05% of our total energy consumption. This is mainly due to the high initial investment required which is a function of equipment and installation costs. Conventional collectors rely on high value materials such as copper and aluminium, which are essential to achieve acceptable performance. However, these materials are also relatively expensive and it is unlikely that component costs will decrease in the future. Moreover, supply of these materials is limited and not large enough to cope with expected increases in demand. Alternative materials such as polymers have been investigated and can theoretically offer significant cost savings due to potential weight reductions, mass production techniques and increased freedom of functional design. However, they are generally not suitable for domestic type solar thermal installations. This is mainly due to their low heat deflection temperature and thermal conductivity. In PolySol we aim to develop a novel polymeric collector that can substitute a metallic solar thermal collector for domestic heating and hot water applications.

Aside from structural inefficiencies, these configurations are complex and expensive to manufacture using existing processes. Construction methods, composite-metal connections and loading complexities present challenges for structural integrity, resulting in over-engineering, increased weight and variable reliability.\n\nThe HPC-Blade project addresses all of these issues by pursuing a novel design and manufacturing solution for blade structures. The concept is drawn from expertise held within eStress Limited - structural analysis specialists within the aerospace industry. The HPC-Blade assembly facilitates the following technology shifts: progression from a spar and core configuration to a rib-based fully stressed blade skin; elimination of mechanically fastened or bonded composite-metal joints; an optimised and appropriate synthesis of composite and metallic materials.\n\nOur novel concept removes the requirement for over-engineering in terms of jointing and compressive instability, and manufacturing is simplified. This provides opportunities for weight saving, improved reliability, faster manufacture and lower cost. Finally, the design is scalable, offering benefits to composite blades of all sizes.\n\nOur consortium will research the detailed design, materials and manufacturing solutions required to exploit the HPC-Blade concept. Blades up to 6m in length will be tested within this project to prove the technology and enable SME exploitation. Application of the design philosophy and features to large scale turbine blades will require proof-of-principle results from this project and longer term testing.

Salt cake is a mixture of aluminum oxides and aluminum nitrides, metal and salts (mainly NaCl and KCl, with small amounts of MgCl2 and CaCl2).\nThe salt cake is a growing environmental problem.  It is proving very difficult to dispose in the Europe and is regarded as hazardous waste. The reason is that when saltcake gets wet it gives of gases, e.g. hydrogen, methane, ammonia. Also water leaching out of the land fill would contain chlorides.\nThe alternative is to try and recycle the saltcake and reclaim the aluminium, aluminium oxide and salt. This is done by grinding up the saltcake and separating out the free aluminium. The residue if then mixed with water, which dissolves out the salts, which are later re crystallised and sold back to the secondary aluminium smelters and aluminium oxide, which may be used in abrasive industry or in the manufacturing of cement.\nThe current technology has high initial and operating cost and not economical in small volume and that is why there are only few aluminium salt cake recycling facilities exist in the Europe. All the salt cake generated by the aluminium recycling plants have to transport the salt cakes to these facilities, which results a large amount of cost due to transportation and associated CO2 emission.\nThe project aims to develop an in situ salt cake recycling technology that will utilize the excess of heat from the flue gas from the rotary furnace and able to reprocess salt cake more efficiently and more economically also in small volume.\nThe process will allow recycling salt cakes in situ at the aluminium recycling plant, without the need for transporting the salt cakes to the salt cake recyclers.

Typically, the salt cake steam contains metallic aluminium, salts (mainly potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl)), and aluminium oxides. These are some of its recoverable components that are non-toxic.\n\nThe EU-funded project ALUSALT (Efficient aluminium salt cake recycling technology) aimed to develop a recycling system that is smaller than existing technologies, making salt cake recycling more accessible and cost effective.\n\nTo achieve its goal, ALUSALT set out to develop a flue gas transfer system that takes the heat and pressure of the flue gas from the rotary furnace. The flue gas is then used as a source of heat for the evaporator. The new process reuses all available energy that is lost during the aluminium recycling process, eliminating the need for additional energy for the salt cake recycling. Proper nozzles will inject the hot flue gas from the rotary furnace.\n\nOne of the main tasks over the first project period was to characterise the flue gases of the aluminium processing. Project partners collected the flue gas particles through magnetic metal separation units and used chemical analysis methods and spectroscopy techniques to determine their composition.\n\nValidating multiphysics models for flue gas injection in the evaporator and gas combustion in the combined heat and power system were also an important part of project work. Significant effort was devoted to determining and testing the suitability of the evaporation technology for the drying brine solution consisting of NaCl and KCl.\n\nOther tasks were to determine the composition and volume of different salt cake gases stemming from the evaporation tanks and to design can combustors to minimise emissions.\n\nThe ALUSALT system should allow in\u00a0situ recycling of salt cakes at the aluminium recycling plant, avoiding their transportation to salt cake recyclers. This minimises costs and increases the competitiveness of the European aluminium recycling industry.

Whilst passive is preferred due to ease of use and low costs, it is not suitable for more than 24 hour use (or patients with specific respiratory needs). The HUMID project will overcome this limitation through the development of a low cost, easy to use, self-sufficient passive heat and moisture exchange (HME) device offering the following innovative features:  - Enhanced humidification performance, boosting the exchange of moisture from the HME material to inhaled respiratory gases, thereby enabling longer term patient use (>72 hours); - Custom designed non-woven material structures offering enhanced moisture sorption and heat exchange properties, thereby eliminating the need for external water reservoirs (reduced healthcare service costs and risk of infection);  - Electronic control module and integrated low cost flow actuator, enabling controlled device actuation and functionality in coordination with patient respiration, energy reductions and battery operation;  Targeting replacement of more complex active humidification systems, the HUMID device will offer improved performance and functionality at lower cost; thereby enabling significant economic and societal benefits to patients and healthcare end-users.
