The school is located in inner-city Liverpool, in areas of high deprivation, with more than twice as many pupils receiving Free School Meals than the National average.  \r\n\r\nWe are a designated \"Centre of Excellence for Spanish\" in our Local Authority, and have served as beacons of good practice for other schools, both locally and nationally. We are passionate about promoting the 'international dimension' across the curriculum, and are currently seeking re-accreditation for the International School Award.\r\n\r\nWe completed a highly successful Erasmus + project in the summer of 2016 (2014-1-UK01-KA101-002175).\r\n\r\nTo build on the success of our previous project we plan over the course of two years, to send 34 members of staff on an eight day Spanish immersion courses in Santander, Spain focusing on language, culture, methodology and school links.\r\n\r\nThis opportunity will ensure that staff are offered consistently high quality training and that the great benefits of the first project are multiplied through more staff building their skills and confidence.\r\n\r\nThey will find new and effective ways to reinforce literacy and focus on reading and writing skills while maintaining the fun elements of language teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nStaff will visit a Spanish Primary School, focusing on the use of literature, providing authentic resources for developing Reading and Writing skills in the target language. This will give staff new ideas, while providing opportunity to reflect on their own practice.\r\n\r\nOur school is proud to be one of the first Primary schools in the country to develop a CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) programme. We have extended our CLIL practice to involve pupils from Year 1- Year 6 and are currently extending it further into EYFS. As this Intensive Language Course takes place in Cantabria, which has a long-established bilingual teaching programme, our staff can visit schools offering a \u2018Plan de Inmersion Linguistica en Infantile\u2019 (PILI) which will greatly enhance their understanding of this teaching approach.  This will allow us to extend provision, involving more staff.\r\n\r\nGiving all staff the opportunity to be fully immersed in language, culture and teaching methodology for a full week will vastly improve our capacity to maintain and build on our excellent provision and continue to update and refresh our skills to be an effective model and source of support for other schools.\r\n\r\nParticipants will increase their Spanish vocabulary and grammatical knowledge, improve their intercultural understanding, and increase their confidence in delivering language lessons. They  will continue to take part in further language training in their own time to build on their learning. \r\n\r\nEngaging the majority of teaching staff (plus teaching assistants and other staff ) will ensure the project has  maximum impact on standards.\r\n\r\nWe have an established process for disseminating our project results through staff meetings, training days and workshops, displays in prominent positions, Federated staff meetings and PowerPoint presentations  and \u2018Learning Walks\u2019 for Governors.\r\n\r\nPartner schools will be invited to make use of ICT facilities including e-mail, blogs, school websites, digital photography and films and a collaborative website \r\n\r\nResources created and uploaded onto websites in collaboration with eTwinning partner schools will be made available for other schools to use through our Local Authority contacts.\r\n\r\nStaff will disseminate their experiences through joint training days, such as our Networked Learning Community organised by the Local Authority and by speaking at nationwide conferences about Language Teaching.\r\n\r\nWe plan to involve the local media in order to share our successes in terms of language teaching and learning. This should help to raise the profile of languages in the area.\r\n\r\nWe will evaluate the impact of our project on language speaking and understanding using the  Common European Framework for Assessment of Languages.\r\n\r\nPupils\u2019 and parents\u2019 views will be collated using a survey tool on electronic media. Pupils will complete formative and summative assessments for each language topic studied, and Asset Language external exams will be introduced in Year 5. Our Languages Co-ordinator will conduct \u2018Pupil Voice\u2019 interviews to discuss attitudes to learning languages and perceptions of international cultures.\r\n\r\nPhotographs will provide evidence of improved school environments, and our websites will reflect increased international activity in all aspects of school life. Governors will complete Observation schedules when undertaking Learning Walks in Spanish and CLIL lessons.\r\n\r\nVisiting teachers will conduct lesson observations, participating in workshops or attending presentations delivered by staff and will complete an evaluation. This will include the expected impact of their visit to our schools on their own school\u2019s development.", "http://www.stcuthbertsliverpool.co.uk", "St Cuthbert's Catholic Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035944_coordinator"], ["5TF", "\u0422\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043b\u0430", "MERSEYSIDE EXPANDING HORIZONS LIMITED", 27091.0, "In Bulgaria Roma live in segregated ghettos that are isolated from the social and cultural life. In the neighborhoods there are no clubs \u043er study halls where children can participate in workshops to develop their creative potential, also missing playgrounds and sports grounds. In Roma neighborhoods are not built spaces for young people, to develop their musical talents or helping them in the curriculum. Organizations working on Roma issues  very often neglect this problem and only target advisory activity. Very often we hear about Roma children being \"unteachable\". This word is embarrassing for the team of our organization and we are determined to change the status quo by supporting formal education through informal methods. The Children and young people are excluded from society and are often unmotivated so they quickly drop out of the educational system. The reasons for this are many, but the main one is lack of understanding of the learning materials.\r\nWith the implementation of the project \"Creativity on wheels\" we aim to influence the process of dropping out of school environment for children and youth of Roma and Turkish origin from the Roma neighborhood Maksuda of the city Varna and the village of Benkovski. They will create sustainable mechanisms for integration by creating better conditions for the involvement of children in extracurricular activities to evolve and to motivate learning. Through the project the children will acquire creative and educational skills, teamwork, creativity and communication skills. Above all they will acquire self-confidence. The method of non-formal education is not yet used in work with Roma children, but it is proven the best approach for the education of children with special needs, as are bilingual children. The project will involve four volunteers from Slovakia and Hungary. Besides foreign volunteers, the project will also include Bulgarian volunteers. The Volunteers who are meeting in our organization are motivated young people who are willing to learn and work with Roma children. Activities envisaged in the project are structured in ways that support the educational process and reduces the number of dropouts. The project will contribute to the development of tolerance and understanding of differences and would melt the barriers that are placed in Roma ghettos so we can work with a large number of children and youth.\r\nProject \"Creativity on wheels\" will have an impact mostly on volunteers and even more on the Roma children, because they never had the opportunity to visit schools to educate and develop them selfs.\r\nWith the implementation of the project will be created and enhanced partnership between the receiving and sending organizations, which in the long run will affect the number and quality of future EVS projects.", "http://www.expandinghorizons.co.uk  ", null, "erasmus_2017-1-BG01-KA105-035873_3"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["0BQ", "The Enterprise Hub", "City of Liverpool College", "Enterprise Hub (EH) is a comprehensive entrepreneurship promotion and business support programme, which will foster the creation of new enterprises from pre start to early stage businesses (up to 36 months).
