Due to changes in staffing and changed expectations for Primary Language Teaching for NC 2104, the schools feel that it is time to re-invest in high quality training to refresh Spanish teaching and learning. The main objectives are to:\r\nEquip teachers with the linguistic skills and confidence to deliver high quality teaching and learning experiences in Primary Languages;\r\nRaise the profile of Spanish in the school and local community and improve intercultural understanding;\r\nMeet the needs of the new National Curriculum 2014;\r\nIncrease self-confidence of lower attainers and EAL pupils across the curriculum;\r\nRaise pupil attainment in languages and across all subjects;\r\nRe-energise our \u2018Centre of Excellence\u2019 status for Spanish, in order to act as a support for other schools, both locally and nationally.\r\n\r\nThe project is designed to last 2 years, focusing initially on 5 key staff, and then engaging the majority of teaching staff (30 teachers across the Federation) for maximum impact on standards. Many of teachers enjoy language learning and are keen to trial new initiatives in our quest aspiring to be \u2018outstanding\u2019. However, a staff skills audit has shown that most staff hold qualifications in French or other languages, and show less confidence using Spanish. In the past we have been able to offer training ourselves for other schools wishing to develop their language teaching, and now need to refresh our skills, methodology and resources to ensure that we are up-to-date and modelling \u2018outstanding teaching and learning\u2019. \r\n\r\nThe expectations of NC14 Languages state an increased focus on the development of Reading and Writing, so our project will focus on effective ways of developing these skills with pupils, while maintaining the fun elements of language teaching and learning. Links with partner schools will provide opportunity for pupils to have purposeful communication, and use of e-twinning websites and electronic media will allow teachers to develop and share authentic resources to enhance Literacy skills. By visiting partner schools, Teachers will strengthen our links and be able to have professional dialogue about effective teaching methods and use of authentic resources. Staff will also undertake intensive language training on a residential course in Santander, from which they should return with improved linguistic competence and confidence in delivering their own Spanish lessons. This will support us in embedding Spanish throughout the curriculum, so that pupils begin to use the language naturally as a tool for communication. We are interested in developing our CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) and will have opportunity to observe this in practice during the residential courses in Cantabria. \r\n\r\nDue to the commitment of the whole staff in this project, we expect the impact to be extensive and not only evident in our Spanish language teaching, but on the school as a whole, and then disseminated nationwide. Standards of teaching and learning in all curriculum areas will be elevated, which will impact on pupils\u2019 motivation and enthusiasm. This may affect their uptake of languages in further education. As small schools in areas of high deprivation, many of our pupils do not have great opportunities to develop their intercultural understanding, so the project would impact on pupils and parents\u2019 attitudes. Furthermore, as we share the outcomes with local media, we expect the school\u2019s profile within the local community to be raised, which could increase pupil stability and our numbers on roll, while attracting new staff. Teachers will be better equipped to meet the needs of National Curriculum 2014, i.e. Language teaching with an increased focus on reading and writing in the target language. Standards in other areas will improve e.g. Literacy due to pupils\u2019 phonological awareness and grammatical understanding being developed in language lessons. Moreover, we have found that language learning significantly increases the self-esteem of lower attaining pupils and those for whom English is an Additional Language, which in turn raises standards in the Core Curriculum areas of Maths and English.", "http://www.stcuthbertsliverpool.co.uk", "St Cuthbert's Catholic Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002175_coordinator"], ["0BQ", "Bon Voyage and Bon Appetit", "City of Liverpool College", 78446.0, "In the project coordinated by Oulu Vocational College  (OSAO) the students and experts of Food Technology, Tourism and Hotel, Restaurant and Catering from OSAO, Vocational college Lappia and  Lapland Tourism college have the opportunity to familiarize with international food and travelling cultures in the form of on-the-job-learning and teacher exchange. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe students will gain priceless experience and a chance to improve their professionality in an international environment.

The participants in the project are 6 students between 16 and 32 years old living in San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna (a town awarded with the title of World Heritage site) and towns nearby. 5 of them will complete a 2-month stay (FCT) in the United Kingdom (5 days teacher / companion) and another one as EramusPro (3 months) in the United Kingdom to promote their professional training there. In addition 1 teacher will make a 1-week training stay in the United Kingdom, and another teacher will make a preliminary visit to ErasmusPro (3 days). \r\nAmong the abilities developed and promoted in this project, aside from the professional skills, are the language proficiency (very important) and the behavioural capability for the autonomy and adaptation to the determining factors of the globalized market.", "http://www.erasmus-education.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-049759_2"], ["5TF", "Environmental Responsibility: from Individual to Community Action", "MERSEYSIDE EXPANDING HORIZONS LIMITED", 18582.0, "Linking social inclusion and environment is a means to attain Sustainable development through a comprehensive approach to achieve this goal. The scope of the \"Environmental Responsibility: From Individual to Community Action\" project (hereinafter, ERICA) is to allow young people aged to start getting involved in environmental challenges both on a local and European level. The project involves the organisation of a youth exchange in Portugal for 25 young people and 5 youth leaders in the town of Arrimal, in the Natural Park of Aire and Candeeiros, Portugal. The age of the participants will be between 18-30 years old, and we will ensure that there will be a balanced gender ratio (50%). We will promote the participation of young people who may face cultural, geographical, and social barriers, through the the implementation of specific measures.\r\n\r\nThe ERICA workshop will take place at the end of September 2018 and it will last 6 days. The youth exchange will make use of non-formal learning methodologies to coach the participants about environmental challenges and solutions, their individual responsibility and the array of actions they can take in order to change their attitude and develop community actions. Among the topics of the workshop, the participants will work on: urban/rural relationships, pollution, the European Agenda 2020 and the SDGs, biodiversity and ecosystems loss, and corporate responsibility. Moreover, the workshop will involve activities to develop intercultural and communication skills, as well as strengthening the European values, as \"united in diversity\". The workshop results will be shared on the Facebook page of the project itself, which will be easily recognisable by its logo.\r\n\r\nThe project will have impacts on the participants, who will experience first- hand how to tackle environmental issues, both changing their own attitude and habits, and also through community action, such as volunteering, but also by being entrepreneurial. In the long term, the project aims to encourage the participants to pursue further education paths regarding sustainable development or getting involved through volunteering or work experience. Both participants and youth leaders will have improved key competences, as well as soft-skills, language capabilities, and self-esteem. All these skills will be validated through several instruments, such as Youthpass, Europass, and Open Badges. The participating organisations will have the opportunity to work in two related fields (social inclusion and environment) and the youth exchange will be a chance to better understand the needs of young people  in relation to environmental issues and to develop innovative actions in line with them. Moreover, the local communities where the participants come from will be involved through a small event that the young people will organise after the exchange. On a longer term, the project aims to contribute to the environmental awareness of young people and their optimism regarding the change they can trigger both from individual and community actions.\r\n\r\nImportant dates:\r\n\r\nAdvance Planning Visit: 30.08.2018 - 31.08.2018\r\nYouth Exchange: 24.09.2018 - 29.09.2019", "http://www.expandinghorizons.co.uk  ", "MERSEYSIDE EXPANDING HORIZONS LIMITED", "erasmus_2018-2-UK01-KA105-048514_coordinator"], ["7DF", "Viv\u00eancias Profissionais e Culturais na Cidadania Europeia", "EUDAIMONIA INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION", 110937.0, "The project \u201cProfessional and Cultural Experiences In the European Citizenship\u201d is addressed to 17 young trainees of the second and third year of Professional Courses, 5 newly graduated in Erasmus Pro, 2 trainees of the educational staff and a mobility of preparation of the ErasmusPro. The students are aged between 16 and 20 and live in the Ave Valley, a lacking and needy region in Portugal.  \r\nThis group of trainees includes young under-aged students facing social and economical  deprivation , therefore the need to be monitored.. We request two accompanying teachers for each destination. This is really important because our pupils had never travelled before by airplane and aren't aware of the required procedures when travelling abroad.\r\nThey are young people who are preparing themselves for various professions in the world of design, arts, sports and science. The curricular design foresees 610 hours of training in work context (active training) in companies or institutions whose professional area matches the required training. The professionals in these areas have to answer with great acuity and agility to the demands of globalization with the consequent requirement of quality in the rendering of services. \r\nThe internationalization strategy has allowed and will allow motivating, enriching and unique professional experiences because they are carried abroad. The simple perspective of training outside Portugal, already divulged throughout the school year 2012/2013 and the implementation of the approved European projects since 2012 has motivated young people to study foreign languages and to complete the course with higher quality. The possibility to serve as an apprentice in Liverpool in the United kingdom, in the Island of Tenerife, Greece or Italy is a very strong incentive to invest in school tasks. The experience will be rewarding because it makes Europe reachable to deprived young people. It will be a unique experience, since most of these teenagers have never been to an airport, and some have never been to the capital city.\r\nThis project responds to the need to promote the European dimension of citizenship and to enlarge the horizons of these young people. In today's Europe, the contact with a new culture or a new language is assumed as a necessity which promotes equal opportunities as it will put at their fingertips an opportunity that only young people born in more favourable economical status can have. It will be a concrete response financed by European funds directed to a social stratum always overlooked. Mobility provides a direct contact with human and professional knowledge and it leads to the development of the professions.  \r\nThe objectives aim at the apprenticeship in Technical courses of:  \r\n- Graphical Design;  \r\n- Laboratorial Analysis; \r\n- Sports Management;\r\nThe project \u201cProfessional and Cultural Experiences In the European Citizenship\u201d aims to:\r\n- improve cultural sensitivity;\r\n- consolidate European citizenship; \r\n- consolidate/ discover professional practices in another country;\r\n- discover a new culture;\r\n- improve the level of the English language;\r\n- learn a new foreign language;               \r\n- blur social disadvantages linked to the social and economical status of the families;\r\n- promote working opportunities.\r\nThe expected results will have an impact in the professional, social and interpersonal abilities, but also in the domain of the foreign language. In the professional areas of the arts and science, general culture, the ability to communicate, the development of the interpersonal relationships assume particular relevancy.  It is expected that participants return more mature, less introverted, and more competent, technically and socially speaking. \r\nThe apprenticeship will be certified by the Europass Mobility and in the professional course, since the evaluation of the active training will be integrated in the calculation of the final average classification of the professional course.\r\nThe mobility will take place between April and July 2019. \r\n11thgrade (with the duration of 58 days):\r\n- 5 trainees from the Sports Management Course in the city of Liverpool, in the United Kingdom with a duration of 58 days; \r\n- 3 trainees from the Graphical Design Course in the Island of Syros, in Greece;\r\n- 5 trainees from the Laboratorial Analysis Course  in Lecce, Italy. \r\n12th grade (for 68 days):\r\n- 4 trainees from the Sports Management Course in Tenerife, Spain;\r\nNewly-graduated in Erasmus Pro.\r\n- 5 newly-graduated mobility (to distribute among trainees from Graphic Design, Lab Analysis and Sports Management courses) with the duration of 120 days, will have Italy as their destination between October  and February 2019. \r\n- Mobility of an element of the School Team that implements the projects Erasmus + with the duration of 4 days to prepare the mobility of the 5 participants of Erasmus Pro.\r\n- 2 trainees of the Educational Staff for Lecce for 4 days.", "http://www.erasmus-education.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PT01-KA116-046997_4"], ["7DF", "Est\u00e1gios na Europa - novas compet\u00eancias num ambiente multicultural III", "EUDAIMONIA INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION", 118698.0, "The internationalization process of the school is part of the context of globalization, with economic, social, educational and cultural policies. Globalization requires a definition of new strategies for a better positioning of the school in relation to its counterparts, giving continuity to the consistent and systematic practices developed since 2007.\r\nThe skills acquired by trainees are a tremendous asset for companies in the region, but also for our institution. In conjunction with companies, the school stimulates meetings, where mobility experiences are presented in order to attract entrepreneurs to our institution, promoting qualification and employability. \r\nThe entrepreneurs know that these trainees have the capacity to bring innovations and cutting-edge procedures, giving companies an improvement in the rooted processes, still allowing a change and improvement in the paradigms of the company. \r\nOn the other hand, the trainees will return to school to participate, in addition to the forums with the companies, in activities of dissemination and motivation.
