Instead, we use a large amount of data logged by vessels carrying out their normal business, and later uploaded to our server for processing. By using a large amount of data, the errors from using less accurate instruments can be remoed. We believe this can be developed to provide a cost effective system that will enable much of the shortfall in surveys to be made up.\nThe benefits of this are safer navigation to all vessels in coastal waters, in particular to the leisure, fishing and workboat sectors, and also greater information for the GIS community, coastal engineers, port, harbour and waterway authorities, and applications such as tide power or offshore wind farms.\nThe system will use GPS receivers equipped with EGNOS to provide the required level of positional accuracy, and will use statistical techniques to remove errors from depth measurements from echo sounders that cannot otherwise be resolved.\nThe data logged will be available both as survey data and as chart data. It will be made available in the IHO S-100 format, which is suited to chart creation by Hydrographic Offices and to the wider GIS community, including use in OGC Web Map Servers and Web Feature Servers.", 9671.0, 395269.0, "COSUDEC", null, null, null, null, "http://www.zazuni.com", null, "fp7_206633_996234039"], ["6DF", "Bringing Organisations and Network Development to higher levels in the farming sector in Europe", "The Landworkers Alliance", "BOND acknowledges the fundamental role farmers and land managers play in the environmental and economic sustainability of the farming sector in Europe, as well as the importance of the way they organise, on Europe\u2019s foods and landscapes. BOND contributes to unleash, strengthen, and organise, the great potential for collective action and networking of individuals, groups and entities of farmers and land managers, focusing on countries with lower organisation levels, with a view to creating strong, dynamic and effective organizations that have a voice and a place in policy design. More specifically, BOND investigates and addresses the constraints and disincentives, and reaches a higher level of participation of farmers as follows: (i) Draw up solutions and build bonding capital within groups, ensuring cohesiveness and trust among people; (ii) Enable organizations to come closer, building bridging capital to form larger networks, help overcome attitudes and constraints that impede collective action; (iii) Build linking capital, developing ties with entities with different interests and powers, including government, donors, academia, private sector, to reach a stronger position in decision-making, and (iv) Engage multi actors and policy makers throughout these processes. BOND\u2019s approach relies on 3 pillars: SEE-learning from success (mobilisation, study tours), LEARN-overcoming constraints (self-analysis, capacity building), TELL-affirming a position in the policy landscape (gaming interface, best practice in regulation, lab experiment), and on involving the youth, women and men (designing a road map for the future), with training sessions and meeting events at every step of the project (interregional forum, national workshops, regional policy roundtables, youth forum).

Virtually all commercial, infrastructure, and scientific satellites carry one or more tanks, for fuel, oxidiser, or coolant. There is no in-orbit method of accurate establishing fluid reserve mass in a tank. Book-keeping methods are employed to track fuel usage, with ever- increasing error, and conservative margins are applied to ensure reserves for end-of-life disposal compliance. Further, fluid slosh presents a challenging control problem - reducing pointing accuracy and introducing potential resonances that threaten platform safety.\n\nAtout Process Ltd. (\u2018Atout\u2019) is a European SME founded in 2010 to develop innovative products based on non-intrusive electromagnetic imaging and measurement techniques. Atout has commercialised a novel monitoring system for the oil and gas, power generation, food and drink and other industries.\n\nThis project will establish the commercial potential for spin-in to the space sector of Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) for accurate real-time measurement of fuel mass and slosh torque vector. A proof-of-concept demonstrator project has already been completed, and a further refinement to TRL6 is nearing completion.\n\nOur industry discussions and analysis to date suggest a strong potential for the technology to extend mission lifetime and improve attitude and orbit control efficiency, yielding a major impact on spacecraft performance. For a geostationary communications platform, this directly translates into substantial commercial benefit to the operator/owner, extending lifetime by up to six months and reducing risk.
