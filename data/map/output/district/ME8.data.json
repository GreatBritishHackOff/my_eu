In most cases, the population attempts to evacuate via the way they entered, bypassing or ignoring emergency exits.  In serious fires, the inability to locate emergency exits can lead to loss of life as in the Kings Cross Underground Station (1988) and D\u00fcsseldorf airport (1996) fires. While terminal staff attempt to direct passengers to the most appropriate exits, they cannot be everywhere throughout the station and they may not be able to reach the population quickly enough.  Throughout the world, emergency signage has traditionally been used to address this problem.  However, recent research has shown that only 38% of people \u2018see\u2019 evacuation signage, even if the sign is located directly in front of them and their vision is unobstructed.  GETAWAY will tackle this problem through the design and development of an Intelligent Active Dynamic Signage System (IADSS).  Through the introduction of lit, flashing and running signs, the traditional static emergency sign will transformed into a Dynamic Signage System.  The increased affordance offered by the DSS will significantly increase the detectability of the emergency exit sign.  By linking the DSS to the alarm system, the DSS will only be activated when needed, thereby overcoming the \u2018learnt irrelevance\u2019 of emergency signs.  Finally, the Active Dynamic Signage System will be linked to an automated system utilising evacuation simulation, CCTV footage and Fire Detection System information to determine the optimal evacuation route as the fire develops, bringing Intelligence to the ADSS.  IADSS enables the terminal Incident Manager to direct passengers to the optimal egress route by activating the appropriate signs within the ADSS.  The IADSS will be tested and validated through trials in the London Underground and Barcelona Metro.  GETAWAY will bring the humble emergency exit sign into the 21st Century.", 83908.0, 2571167.0, "GETAWAY", "Better crisis evacuation for rail and metro", "Smarter signage and a decision-support system for emergencies in railways and metro stations will help users get to safety more quickly.", "Underground and overground metro and rail stations in European cities have grown into intricate networks of tunnels and spaces dotted with retail and other services. While travellers enjoy this interconnectivity and diversity, the maze of tunnels can turn into a nightmare in emergency situations such as fires or terror attacks.\n\nThe EU-funded project GETAWAY (Generating simulations to enable testing of alternative routes to improve wayinding in evacuation of over-ground and underground terminals) is addressing this challenge through better escape plans. It is proposing an improved signage system that will be 50\u00a0% more visible without changing the size or content of signs.\n\nThis sophisticated system is being designed to exploit environmental data on developing hazardous situations, supported by video technology that analyses the number of people in a given area. Designed to be integrated into both new and existing transport terminals, it would be capable of performing simulations three times faster than in real time.\n\nTo achieve its aims, the project team is outlining specifications to develop the system, conducting trials and evaluating the effectiveness of the development components. The key subsystems are a fire detection and alarm system, image analysis engine, evacuation simulation engine and decision-making engine.\n\nAlready, the project team has developed new image analysis algorithms and a first version of the user interface for incident managers to operate the system. It outlined fire simulation models and developed the new dynamic signage system based on progressively illuminated LED technology.\n\nIntensive testing has already taken place to assess its effectiveness in different European stations. The results have revealed that twice as many people are likely to see and follow the new emergency signage. Once fully developed, the GETAWAY system is set to support security in European rail stations and ultimately save lives in emergency situations.", "http://www.getaway-project.eu/", "http://www.hochikieurope.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/144001.jpg", "fp7_100354_967406415"]]}}, "outwardCode": "ME8"}
