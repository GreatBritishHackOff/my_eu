Three European regions will be participating in this effort: the UK (the Midlands and Plymouth), the Brussels area and Wallonia, and the Weser-Ems region in NorthWest Germany. Each of these regions will deploy a new hydrogen refuelling site to close the gaps in a continuous \u2018hydrogen highways\u2019 that leads from Scotland via the Midlands to London, connecting to Brussels and on to Cologne and Hamburg/Scandinavia/Berlin via Bremen.\nThe vehicles employed are low-cost, high fuel-efficiency, hybridised, light-weight passenger cars specifically designed for city and regional transport. These vehicles provide a complementary pathway to commercialisation to the large Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of hydrogen fuel cell options, by allowing near-term rollout on a commercial basis to a wide range of users \u2013 in parallel with the planned rollouts for large OEM vehicles from 2015. Their deployment regions will gain the infrastructure, public exposure and technological understanding to act as seed locations for future large scale OEM vehicle rollout.\nIn view of the lower vehicle costs, this project will deploy an unprecedented number of road vehicles for a demonstration project, with three OEM\u2019s contributing 20, 10 and 20 vehicles respectively to the project. These will be put in the hands of users in a variety of real-life operating environments. An extensive data monitoring exercise will run throughout the demonstration phase, allowing the reliability of the vehicles tested by different users to be evaluated and leading to recommendations for the improvement of future, fully commercial vehicle designs.\nThe three European regions will deploy several hydrogen refuelling stations, adding a total of 3 new stations to existing supply sites, contributing to some of the first regional hydrogen refuelling clusters in Europe. Each region will as a consequence either own a high-standard filling station with = high capacity (200 kg/day) and high performance (70 MPa) refuelling technology (Wallonia, Weser-Ems), or build on existing smaller stations of lower capacity and pressure (UK, Midlands and Plymouth).\nThe project will be a near-commercial stepping stone and will include a reach-out activity timed to coincide with OEM\u2019s commercialisation plans in the post-2015 period, to attract further vehicles to the newly developed infrastructures - by offering cost effective and readily available focal points for additional hydrogen fleets developing around these regions.

Concentrating initially on the Welsh Dyfi Biosphere Reserve, we will develop a citizens\u2019 observatory framework, and then validate the work within the context of the UK National Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) and internationally, within the WNBR; specifically, within Greek and German Reserves. The infrastructure we develop will exploit technological developments in ubiquitous mobile devices, crowd-sourcing of geographic information and the operationalising of standards based SDI such as the UK Location Information Infrastructure. It will enable citizens living within Biosphere Reserves to collect environmental information on a range of parameters including species distribution, flooding and land cover/use. A main driver will be the opportunity to participate in environmental governance. Data quality issues will be addressed by using networks of \u201cpeople as sensors\u201d and by analysing observations and measurements in real-time combination with authoritative models and datasets. The citizen\u2019s observatory framework will integrate with evolving INSPIRE compliant national SDI\u2019s and allow the fusion of citizen sourced data with reference data from public authorities in support of policy objectives. To maximise impact, COBWEB will work within the processes of the standards defining organisations. Specifically, we will aim to improve the usability of Sensor Web Enablement standards with mobile devices, develop widespread acceptance of the data quality measures we develop and maximise the commercial appeal of COBWEB outputs. The end result we are aiming for is a toolkit and a set of models that demonstrably works in different European countries and which is accepted as a core information system component of the WNBR.

Using techniques for crowdsourcing geographic information, the initial focus is species distribution, flooding and land cover of a Welsh reserve.", "Environmental research usually involves small groups doing a great deal of field and laboratory work over long periods; progress is labour intensive and slow. One way to improve matters is by utilising local residents as sources of data.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Citizen observatory web' (http://cobwebproject.eu (COBWEB)) aims to develop a citizens' observatory framework. The concept means enabling residents and users of biosphere reserves to collect environmental data using mobile devices. Based on techniques involving crowdsourcing geographic information, the framework will enable residents to collect data relevant to species distribution, flooding and land cover/use.\n\nProject research also addresses the known reliability issues surrounding citizen-supplied data, and will allow such data to be fused with more reliable sources. The framework initially focuses on Wales' Dyfi Biosphere Reserve, to be validated in other reserves in Germany and Greece. The project's 14 members came together in November 2012, with work slated to run until October 2016.\n\nThe first 18 months first saw stakeholder consultation and definition of user requirements. The project conducted a prototype design activity involving interested parties, and created a pilot Access Management Federation in conjunction with several Group on Earth Observations (GEO) members.\n\nRequirements collated so far are guiding development of the technical architecture, plus demonstrators in three initial areas: biological monitoring, flooding and validation of satellite data. Prototypes covering the first two are mature, and requirements for the third have been defined. A further prototype has been developed, demonstrating how the project's portals may work with its version of GeoNetwork.\n\nWork to date has progressed understanding of methodologies for utilising sensors in environments of limited connectivity, and of how robust and crowdsourced data may be combined.\n\nFollowing field testing in 2014 and 2015, the project issued calls for ideas from groups able to mobilise citizens in the Dyfi Biosphere Reserve. Such proposals will guide upcoming research phases, leading to full demonstration in 2015.\n\nThe COBWEB project will yield open-source software tools able to support multiple citizen observatory scenarios.

Anthropogenic pressures, however, cause serious threat to ecosystems, leading to habitat degradation, increased risk of collapse and loss of ecosystem services. Knowledge-based conservation, management and restoration policies are needed to improve ecosystem benefits in face of increasing pressures. ECOPOTENTIAL makes significant progress beyond the state-of-the-art and creates a unified framework for ecosystem studies and management of protected areas (PA). ECOPOTENTIAL focuses on internationally recognized PAs in Europe and beyond in a wide range of biogeographic regions, and it includes UNESCO, Natura2000 and LTER sites and Large Marine Ecosystems. Best use of Earth Observation (EO) and monitoring data is enabled by new EO open-access ecosystem data services (ECOPERNICUS). Modelling approaches including information from EO data are devised, ecosystem services in current and future conditions are assessed and the requirements of future protected areas are defined. Conceptual approaches based on Essential Variables, Macrosystem Ecology and cross-scale interactions allow for a deeper understanding of the Earth's Critical Zone. Open and interoperable access to data and knowledge is assured by a GEO Ecosystem Virtual Laboratory Platform, fully integrated in GEOSS. Support to transparent and knowledge-based conservation and management policies, able to include information from EO data, is developed. Knowledge gained in the PAs is upscaled to pan-European conditions and used for planning and management of future PAs. A permanent stakeholder consultancy group (GEO Ecosystem Community of Practice) will be created. Capacity building is pursued at all levels.
