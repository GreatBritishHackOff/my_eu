One of the most important problems in the process of widening European opportunities is to access to young people living in rural areas. When we consider the ratio of the young population in Turkey, a lot of young people lives in the villages, or center of little towns and it is unfortunately not possible for these young people to reach the information that will contribute to them especially the European opportunities.\r\n\r\nAct for Peace project is a youth exchange project aimed at bringing European opportunities to young people to change their lives and also aiming to increase the capacities of young people by carrying out art (theater-pantomime) activities. Our project will held on 16.07.2018-26.07.2018 with 4 participants and 1 leader from each country of 6 different countries and 9 young people and 1 leader from Turkey, Izmir, Bademler Village (Italy, Romania, Lithuania, Estonia, Czech Republic, England) in Bademler village of Urla, participants (Youth leaders, young volunteers, youth who are experiencing unemployment problems from rural areas, in the age range of 18-30 years.\r\n\r\nOur project aims to inform young people with different and alternative method (theatre and non-formal education) at the place where they live, instead of gathering and informing young people in the school. One of the important goals of our project is to make young people acquire a different experience by applying alternative methods on the basis of art and culture and to make young people aware of different experiences of Bademler Village by blending their unique values with the cultures of the participants.\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that the project will provide young people living in rural areas, a space to benefit from youth programs and encourage intercultural learning, arts and communication as well as theater activities to be carried out and to improve their  leadership skills and self-confidence in this direction . In the project, Bademler and surrounding villages will be visited, methods such as sessions, outdoor activities, village visits and local informations, interviews with local people, theater-pantomime workshops, theater play and digital video works will be performed using the non-formal training methods.\r\n\r\nIt is important that a similar project targeting young people living up to this time has not been made in the region where our project is implemented. It is believed that the project will have a positive impact on their lives in the short term with the informing of many young people living in the region about European Opportunities and in the long term, it will be possible to have knowledge about many genuine European Opportunities in Urla county and villages throughout the province of Izm\u0131r. It is predicted that young unemployed who will have awareness will decrease the unemployement in positive direction, also Bademler village is one of the peasants of the Aegean Civilizations and has a high awareness of issues such as gender equality and the environment. For this reason, it is anticipated that such European values \u200b\u200bwill increase in effect throughout the province.", "http://www.nefelieducation.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-TR01-KA105-048111_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["6AZ", "NEFELI EDUCATION COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 22552.0, "Multi-country programmes, regional integration and territorial cooperation (22.02.04.01)", "fts_2017_45197", 2017], ["6AZ", "NEFELI EDUCATION COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 3506.0, "Eastern Partnership \u2014 Poverty reduction and sustainable development (22.04.02.02)", "fts_2017_47172", 2017], ["6AZ", "NEFELI EDUCATION COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 8858.0, "Eastern Partnership \u2014 Poverty reduction and sustainable development (22.04.02.02)", "fts_2017_48545", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "PO3"}
