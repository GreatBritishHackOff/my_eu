Their incarceration ended what had become a national crisis in a small country accustomed to a lack of criminal activity. The suspects served prison terms ranging from one to seventeen years. Over the next few months Iceland's state prosecutor will exonerate all six. This unprecedented act is due to a formal acknowledgment that the suspects were all suffering from \"Memory Distrust Syndrome\", a psychological condition where an individual doubts their own memory. Due to a combination of lengthy interrogations, long periods of solitary confinement and the intense pressure of the case, all of the suspects appear to have fabricated their own involvement in a crime that none of them committed. Some of the suspects were so badly afflicted that, to this day, they are unsure of whether or not they committed murder. This is the story of Europe's strangest miscarriage of justice. Out of Thin Air is a docudrama told entirely by those involved in the case. At the centre of the story are the couple Erla and Saevar (both convicted); a young and ambitious journalist, Helga, who exposes the fault lines in the case; psychologist Gisli Gudjonsson, now a leading expert on Memory Distrust Syndrome, but a young detective in the Icelandic police force at the time of the disappearances; and ex Nazi Karl Schutz from Germany, flown in to take charge of the case.In a style similar to 'Man on Wire', interviews with the key characters and dramatic reconstructions are interwoven with pictures and archive from the '70s.
