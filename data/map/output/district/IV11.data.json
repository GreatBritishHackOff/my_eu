This fits in with the national 1+2 policy for teaching languages.\r\nI have sufficient spanish to communicate with children but need to develop my confidence in methods of teaching languages.\r\nIn order to do this I have identified a one week immersion course being run by LFEE in Malaga in October 2017. The aims of this course match the needs I have identified in myself in order to be able to move the school forward.  These are:\r\nTo improve methodological expertise in the teaching of Spanish to young learners.\r\nTo provide materials and ideas suitable for the teaching of Spanish at primary level.\r\nTo develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary Spain.\r\nTo improve  competence and performance in Spanish.\r\nTo use Internet and other ICT resources in your class.\r\nAfter consultation with my headteacher, I  have contacted LFEE and they have reserved me a place on this course.\r\nIf I receive funding I will contact LFEE and make suitable arrangements for my travel. I will also carry out all necessary preparation for the course.\r\nDuring my week in Spain, I hope to meet like minded colleagues from other countries. I also hope to make links with spanish schools which can be continued on my return to Scotland. I also hope to gain lots of practical games, resources and ideas for teaching spanish to children. I also hope to develop a plan for implementing spanish into my primary classroom.\r\n\r\nOn my return I will continue to develop resources and start to teach spanish in my school. I will share what I have learnt with my colleagues in my own school (and cluster of local primary schools) and establish links with the language department at the secondary school.  The school will include the wider community by holding a languages assembly to which the press will be invited.", "http://www.cromartyprimary.wordpress.com", "Cromarty Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035364_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "IV11"}
