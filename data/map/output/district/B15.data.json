Studies in several model organisms including mammals have suggested that AiP is evolutionary conserved, and may have relevance to both tissue regeneration and tumourigenesis. Intriguingly, caspases, the proteases that normally execute apoptosis, have been implicated to play key roles in AiP through activation of their downstream growth signals. However, the underlying mechanism of AiP remains elusive. Systematic approaches are thus in need to dissect the regulatory network of AiP. By taking advantages of the developing Drosophila eye as an epithelium composed of both proliferating and differentiating tissues, our previous work has revealed that distinct mechanisms of AiP exist in tissues with different developmental potentials. In the proliferating tissue where cells are actively dividing, the initiator caspase (Caspase-9 like) coordinates apoptosis and AiP. While in the differentiating tissue where cells have exited the cell cycle, the effector caspases (Caspase-3 like) activate cell cycle re-entry. Built upon this finding, the goal of the proposed project is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of AiP. To achieve this, we have developed three sensitive and unique assays for analysis of AiP. By employing these assays together with proteomic approaches and systematic screens, we aim at (1) determining how caspases initiate AiP in apoptotic cells; (2) elucidating how Spitz/EGFR signalling, a growth signal that we identified mediating AiP, is activated; and (3) identifying and characterizing critical kinase regulators of AiP in both proliferating and differentiating tissues.

To decipher large metabolic data sets advanced statistical and bioinformatic tools are commonly employed.\nAlthough metabolomics has only recently emerged, dynamic profiles generated in Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) are becoming increasingly important to analyse biological networks in a quantitative manner and as part of systems biology approaches. MFA allows us to probe hypotheses by incorporating a priori biological knowledge to provide practical descriptions of observed cell behaviours, and to characterise the outcome of network perturbations. Flux analysis is of particular value for the diagnosis, differentiation and elucidation of mechanisms in cancer. This was recognised as early as 1924 by the Nobel Prize winner Otto Warburg who attributed cancer to a change in cellular energy production. This theme has experienced a revival in recent years through research, which has established mitochondrial dysfunction as a major mechanism in cancer.\nThis proposal seeks funding for a truly interdisciplinary European consortium to train researchers to exploit the gains of new technologies provided by metabolic flux analysis in the context of cancer with a mixed focus on new developments and applied end-points.", 812142.0, 3674517.0, "METAFLUX", "Cancer therapy via metabolic flux analysis", "Metabolic flux is the movement of metabolites such as chemicals and molecules in cellular metabolic pathways.

Relevant laboratory and research skills were imparted through training courses to cover metabolism, MFA, and nuclear magnetic resonance\u00a0(NMR)-based analytical methods and mass spectrometry (MS). Transferable skills training in communication and listening skills, scientific writing and computer programming was also provided.

The aim of the proposed project is thus to explore public perceptions of coastal management scenarios seeking to mitigate climate change impacts, through the lens of social capital. Specifically, the project will examine public perceptions of the likely (non-economic) social costs and benefits arising from implementing different mitigation strategies and how local social capital differentiates these perceptions.

This kind of everyday novelty is hard for a robot. The most advanced robots can perform a task such as making a drink, which involves grasping, pouring and twisting off a cap from a jar.

If we substitute a mug for a glass in a task that involved pouring liquid from the mug or glass into another object, the pouring position changes, as changes the grasping position. Perhaps we would grasp the mug by the handle, and then tip it sideways to pour. All of this means that if robots are ever going to be useful in natural settings where manipulation is involved that they need ways of generalising on the fly to cope with novel objects, and perhaps novel tasks.

Individuals with WS show heighted emotional responses and amygdala activity to happy faces and fearful/threatening non-social scenes but a reduced amygdala response to fearful faces. Thus, cultural and genetic factors can affect emotional responding in specific situations. Emotion regulation involves the processes by which individuals influence the emotions that they experience and express, and may be related to individual differences in emotional responding. There are notable differences in the neural substrates and effects on emotional responding of different emotion regulation processes used in different contexts. fMRI, EEG, behavioural observation, physiological measurement and self-reported emotional experience will be used to investigate the variation in emotion regulation associated with IC factors. IC variation will be measured at a group level (cultural group comparison), at an individual level (affiliation towards specific IC cultural values) and within individuals (manipulation of the temporary salience of a particular IC value), within the context of spontaneous emotion regulation and instructed antecedent and response focussed up- or down-regulation of positive or negative emotional responses.

The concept was applied to key track maintenance processes, including tamping, grinding, and switches and crossings (S&C) maintenance. Initial comparison of best practices of several European rail agencies highlighted potential technologies that could reduce maintenance times.\n\nA second area of focus was inspection technologies. The project concluded that continuous, daily track monitoring was possible using in-service trains running at normal speeds. Project partners developed a laser-based trolley for assessing S&Cs, and the associated algorithms. The project's switch inspection device will also be able to monitor tack geometry.

NVGH is a company with a mission to develop affordable and effective vaccines against infectious diseases of impoverished communities in the developing world. Its first vaccine, against Salmonella Typhi, is in clinical trails in South-East Asia, with vaccines against Salmonella Paratyphi, nontyphoidal Salmonella, meningococcus and Shigella in preclinical development. UoB is an international leader in investigating immune responses to bacteria, particularly Salmonellae, and in relating immunity to microbial antigens. The two institutions have forged strong links over the last year which form the framework of the VADER programme. The fellows will work on four related projects embedded within existing vaccine programmes at NVGH where they will work as part of a team of scientists. With vaccines in clinical trials, trainees will be able to explore immune responses in human vaccinees as well as animals. In their projects, they will be trained in vaccine design and immunology and learn how differences in vaccine engineering affect immune responses.

The focus of the capacity building will be on three key botanical research topics: A) Plants and Seed Conservation, B) Genetic Resource Diversity and Biotechnology, and C) Utilisation and Access Benefit Sharing. These are research topics highly relevant to the FP7 KBBE and Environment. The BOT-ERA project will last 36 months and be implemented by a dedicated team of experienced RBG researchers. It will be overseen by a steering committee involving the consortium partners plus members of the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Environment, NCARE, ICARDA and Royal Marine Conservation Society of Jordan.

In my proposal, I will concentrate on 4 important topics where I believe that quasirandomness is crucial to further progress: hypergraph matchings, decompositions of graphs, topological subgraphs as well as sparse graphs and hypergraphs.\n\nAs an illustration of a matching problem, consider a group of people and construct a graph by drawing an edge if they like each other - a perfect matching splits the people into teams of 2 which can work together. How and when this can be achieved for teams of 2 is well understood, but not for teams of 3 or more people. This can be formulated as a hypergraph matching problem. I believe that quasirandom decompositions can be used to give quite general sufficient conditions which guarantee a perfect hypergraph matching.\n\nA better understanding of quasirandomness of sparse hypergraphs would have applications e.g. to checking whether a Boolean formula is satisfiable.

During the epithelial to mesenchymal transition, expression of the non-epithelial N-cadherin is upregulated, whereas E-cadherin expression is downregulated- a phenomenon known as the cadherin switch. In the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, this process is accompanied by an increased cell motility that is directly dependent on N-cadherin expression. In vivo studies demonstrated that N-cadherin expressing MCF-7 tumors showed increased invasiveness and metastasis, as well as increased responsiveness to fibroblast growth factor (FGF). PTPs are known regulators of both receptor tyrosine kinases and cadherin function. Dynamic (de)phosphorylation of components of the N-cadherin adhesion complex may be the key event in regulating the migratory properties of breast carcinoma cells.\nMCF-7 cells stably expressing N-cadherin have already been obtained, which display increased migration towards FGF in vitro. From the N-cadherin expressing cell line, cells where PTPs are stably downregulated using shRNAi will be generated. With this model system, the effect of individual PTPs on N-cadherin-mediated adhesion, migration and invasion will be assayed in vitro.

Recent research has shown that the application of FRs within consumer goods and materials has led to contamination of indoor environments with consequences for human exposure.

Hilbert conjectured that the answer to this problem was `no.' However, in 1957, Kolmogorov together with his student Arnold gave a positive solution in the continuous case: every continuous function of n variables taken from the closed unit interval can be represented as a linear superposition of one-variable functions and the two-variable function addition. One might expect this result to have applications (for example to data analysis), since it allows for multi-dimensional functions to be expressed as `simpler' functions of one variable and addition. However, whilst being of great theoretical interest, Kolmogorov's result is highly non-constructive and does not obviously allow for this.

High-throughput screening of an extensive compound library led to the identification of novel anti-tubercular compounds against the essential mycobacterial protein MmpL3.\n\nWith respect to the identification of direct InhA inhibitors, the consortium developed a novel platform for screening DNA-encoded small molecule libraries. In combination with nanotechnology, this platform could assist in the discovery of drugs with enhanced bioavailability, solubility and stability.\n\nConsiderable part of the ORCHID work was based on basic research to identify the specificity of some beta-lactam compounds for L,D-transpeptidase. The latter is a key enzyme implicated in peptidoglycan cross-linking and constitutes an active target against M.tuberculosis. Particular emphasis was given to carbapenems due to their proven efficacy against MDR-TB in combination therapy regimens.\n\nTaken together, the ORCHID-identified candidate molecules provide alternative drugs for a shorter and more specific treatment against TB.

Because of shared routes of transmission, HCV co-infection is recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality among HIV-1 infected persons. The epidemiology and clinical features of co-infected subjects are well documented, however, there is a paucity of basic scientific studies addressing the interactions between these pathogens. There is undoubtedly a complex interplay between pathogens and the host immune response. This was highlighted when the Merck HIV-1 vaccine trial was halted due to increased HIV-1 transmission amongst vaccine recipients with previous adenovirus infection, suggesting that immune responses specific for adenovirus vector antigens were detrimental. We propose that pathogen evasion and dysregulation of host immune responses plays a key role in co-infection associated morbidity. We will test this hypothesis by establishing in vitro and ex vivo co-infection model systems to study pathogen interactions and assess the effect(s) of co-infection on innate signalling and adaptive immune responses.

Neither for efficiency and emission levels, for example, nor for more technical specifications like cycling ability and turn-down ratio can clear targets be set and benchmarks applied that are independent from the energy supply grid  environment the FC system is operating in.\nTherefore it was decided to omit such targets from the JU programme, which on the other hand constitutes an unsatisfactory situation due to the lack of clear technical guidelines.\nThe project will contribute to solving this situation by collecting and reviewing information on stationary FC operations in various grid environments and application strategies.

While Europe paid significant efforts in improving the engineering aspects of PEMFCs, including hydrogen refuelling stations, development of alternative catalysts for Pt require further investments. Global attempts are focused on developing catalyst systems with less Pt or no Pt at all. In this regard, macromolecules with N4-chelate structure are considered as alternatives for Pt ECs especially for the ORR. Recently, non-precious carbon alloy catalysts (CAC) received considerable attention as the addition of nitrogen and metal atoms into the CNT matrix tend to improve their catalytic activity towards ORR. The induced activity of CNTs after such doping is mainly attributed to changes in electronic structure with an impurity band near the Fermi level. However, CAC performances are still inferior to that of Pt. One major drawback with reported CACs is that they do not control the size of metal dopants as the sintering tends to agglomerate them and leaves them in the CNT matrix as mere surface bound particles. Hence it is imperative to control the metal doping in the atomic scale as they can donate more electrons to the CNT matrix than nitrogen and could induce more catalytic activity. Thus in this proposal, we plan to prepare CACs with metal dopants controlled in the atomic scale to alter the electronic structure with improved durability as these metal atoms are now part of the CNT matrix.

This problem arises because current syntactic analyzers are trained primarily on syntactically annotated newspaper texts. In particular, the major syntactic resource for training syntactic analyzers in English is an annotated text collection called the Penn-Tree Bank. The Penn-Tree Bank contains texts from only one genre that is economic news. However, the syntactic analyzers are applied to a wide range of text genres such as emails, newsgroups, blogs, consumer reviews, newspapers with mostly non-economic text, spoken language etc. When applied to these texts the error rate doubles. As a result of a doubled error rate the syntactic analyzer assigns the wrong syntactic structures to the input sentences. In other words, it confuses the subject and object in a sentence. Therefore it is no longer able to answer the critical questions in natural language understanding: Who does what to whom and why and when. For real-world applications this means that the robot may fail to understand the instructions or commands posed by the customer.\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to reduce this gap and to provide techniques that obtain a higher accuracy and allow the adaptation to out-of domain genres in an easy and economically acceptable way.

HCV is one of the most problematic of the RNA viruses, with a slow indolent course of infection often characterised by decades of steady decline, with a significant fraction of infected subjects developing liver disease. Unfortunately our understanding of this disease has been hampered by a lack of virus culture systems and it is only now that we are beginning to develop the molecular tools to investigate the viral life cycle, an essential pre-requisite to developing any form of rational anti-viral therapy. We previously reported a crucial role for cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) in HCV infectivity. To carry out its function(s), PKA has to be delivered to its site of action within the cell, and this is achieved by scaffolding via A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP) which tether PKA to target membranes or organelles. Our recent data showing that: (i) HCV Core encodes a potential AKAP; (ii) recombinant HCV Core associates with PKA and (iii) HCV structural proteins negatively regulate cAMP-PKA responsiveness, support a novel mechanism for HCV to perturb PKA signalling. PKA plays an important role in the regulation of protein trafficking along the constitutive secretory pathways. By supplying an aberrant anchoring signal to PKA, HCV promotes its localisation to lipid droplets where virus assembly and egress of infectious particles occurs from the cell. This is the first report of a virus encoded AKAP that provides a novel mechanism for pathogens to hijack PKA signalling to defined cellular locations and to subvert host cell defence mechanisms. This proposal seeks to establish a new model of how HCV Core disrupts and re-targets cellular regulators and perturbs hepatocyte biology.

Road traffic remains one of the major sources of particulate matter, and diesel emissions are by far the largest source of atmospheric nanoparticles in urban areas.  Semi-volatile organic compounds emitted largely in the condensed matter phase are a major component of diesel emissions, and as primary particles are advected from their road traffic source, the semi-volatile compounds vaporise and are oxidised, forming a greater mass of secondary organic aerosol (SOA).  However, the semi-volatile compounds are extremely poorly characterised as they are not resolved by traditional gas chromatographic methods, presenting an unresolved complex mixture (UCM).  For this reason, despite being a major precursor of SOA, such compounds are often poorly represented or completely omitted from atmospheric chemistry-transport models.  This proposal is concerned with applying new two dimensional gas chromatographic methods to characterisation of the UCM at a molecular level which will be followed by studies of the physico-chemical properties of representative components of the semi-volatile emissions.  The very abundant nucleation nanoparticle mode of diesel emissions is comprised almost entirely of semi-volatile organic material and hence these particles are progressively lost from the atmosphere by evaporation.

We will investigate the roles of CCL19 and CCL21, their GPCR, CCR7, and ACR, CCRL1, in regulating tumor progression and orchestrating anti-tumor immunity and its suppression, including in the setting of experimental tumor immunotherapy. The proposed work will entail studies of transplanted murine tumors with hosts and tumors having modified expression levels of chemokines, their GPCR and ACR as well as using models with disrupted function of specific immune cells. The host provides state of the art facilities and profound immunological expertise, whereas the applicant brings complementary competence in molecular biology and cancer and will be able to synergize in order to reach the research objectives.

Foam packaging is an essential part of the food processing and transport process to prevent damage and spoilage. However, they are made from synthetic polymers and have low density (50 kg/m3) which makes them difficult to recycle economically. Thus, the vast majority of foams are landfilled at the end-of-life where they take-up a large volume and resist degradation. In addition, foamed polymers constitute a very high level of litter which is persistent in the environment and is the main source of marine debris. As a result of these factors, food retailers are looking to develop foamed packing solutions based on biodegradable polymers from natural sources.

Condition monitoring integrated in a wireless network with state-of-the-art concepts for signal transmission will ensure that interference does not impinge on safety. Technology will be easily applied to freight trains and provide an important upgrade to the monitoring of passenger trains as well.\n\nResearchers have identified three use scenarios to inspect bearings and gearboxes based on end-user requirements. Continuous structural health monitoring in older freight locomotives will enable investigation of asset condition without dismantling the wheelsets. \n\nIn service monitoring of axle box bearings in freight wagons will replace routine inspection and eliminate the need to take the vehicles out of service to perform the inspection. Finally, a semi-permanent installation in a fleet of passenger trains will update fault detection with a graphical user interface locating trains and indicating the presence of any faults.\n\nPartners are currently developing electronic components for the prototype hardware to be used in acquisition of vibration and acoustic signals from bearings and gearboxes. The wireless network system will integrate sensors via an existing proprietary interface. The team has also evaluated various energy harvesting concepts, deciding on exploitation of vibration energy during motion and thermal harvesting otherwise.\n\nThe flexible, short-range, autonomous wireless monitoring network and associated standards for operation developed within the scope of WIRAILCOM will have major impact on the safety of freight transport throughout Europe. In addition, technologies will help the small and medium-sized enterprises in the consortium enhance their competitive edge in providing condition monitoring and inspection technology that private and government owners seek.

Very recently, the European rail industry has started showing signs of recovery after a long period of steady decline. The technological advances in train design during the last few decades have led to the manufacturing of faster and more comfortable trains making rail transport a more attractive option for passengers in comparison to other means of transportation. The need for the society to employ greener transportation policies is expected to further enhance the role of rail transport in the global economy. Today rail networks across Europe are getting busier with trains travelling at higher speeds, carrying more passengers and heavier axle loads than ever before. The combination of these factors has put considerable pressure on the existing infrastructure, leading to increased demands in inspection and maintenance of rail assets. The expenditure for inspection and maintenance has thus, grown steadily over the last few years without however being followed by a significant improvement of the industry\u2019s safety records. A large proportion of all equipment related accidents in the rail industry is due to failed train wheels and axles. The continuous increase in train operating speeds means that catastrophic failure of a wheel or axle may result in very serious derailments, such as the one that took place in Eschede, Germany in 1998, causing loss of life, injuries, severe disruption in the operation of the network, damage to the tracks, unnecessary costs, and loss of confidence in rail transport by the general public.

Faster and more comfortable trains are making rail transport a more attractive option as they are now capable of carrying more passengers and heavier axle loads than ever before. This puts considerable pressure on the existing infrastructure, leading to increased inspection and maintenance of rail assets. While inspection and maintenance costs have grown steadily in recent years, no significant improvement of the industry's safety records has been observed.\n\nMany rail accidents are due to failed train wheels and axles, where derailment can have catastrophic results at high speeds. The EU-funded 'Development of novel inspection systems for railway wheelsets' (Saferail) project is developing and successfully implementing a novel online system to inspect wheels and axles of moving trains and upgrade safety standards. It is proposing a combined ultrasonic-electromagnetic system for faster and more reliable inspection of new and old wheel sets during their production and maintenance.\n\nIn recent years, rail accidents in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have highlighted the need for better safety measures. In 1996, a freight train accident occurred due to an axle failure in Rickerscote, UK; it resulted in the death of one person and injury of several others. The 1998 accident in Eschede, Germany, initiated by a single failed wheel, caused the death of more than 100 passengers and 88 severe injuries. More recently, the S-Bahn derailment at Kaulsdorf, Germany in 2009 was brought about by a wheel set failure. As rail networks become busier and train speeds increase, the number of incidents linked to failed train wheel sets is expected to grow. Yet minimising wheel set failures also helps reduce maintenance costs, representing an important consideration for both train and light rail vehicle operators.\n\nCurrent available online systems detect severe wheel set defects just before they result in a catastrophic failure. Consequently, severe surface-breaking or deep internal defects are not being properly detected until the defective wheel set is taken out of service for inspection and maintenance.\n\nIn other words, the current technology deployed cannot inspect wheel sets with maximum reliability. The Saferail project is very close to developing the necessary technology for reliable and accurate inspection of wheel sets online, as well as during their production and maintenance.

From this work, certain genes were found to be associated with gonadal dysgenesis.\n\nEpigenetic studies revealed that over 100 sex-specific genes \u2013 mainly linked to androgen biosynthesis \u2013 were methylated in patients with DSD. These findings demonstrated the diagnostic potential of epigenotyping in the future diagnostic workup of these disorders.\n\nThe mechanisms of sexual development were also of interest to the consortium. By using a mouse model, partners investigated the action of the male hormones or androgens during embryology. Importantly, certain mutations in the androgen receptor were associated with diminished hormone activity that could potentially lead to perturbed sexual development.\n\nUsing chromatography and spectrometry techniques, EURODSD scientists succeeded in quantifying several different steroids in blood plasma and urine. This method proved invaluable for diagnosing a broad variety of DSDs.\n\nCollectively, EURODSD-developed methods hold the potential to lead to a more sensitive, accurate, fast and effective diagnosis of known monogenic DSDs.

By employing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to liquefy and store cryogens, CryoHub will balance the power grid, while meeting the cooling demand of a refrigerated food warehouse and recovering the waste heat from its equipment and components.\nThe intermittent supply is a major obstacle to the RES power market. In reality, RES are fickle forces, prone to over-producing when demand is low and failing to meet requirements when demand peaks. Europe is about to generate 20% of its required energy from RES by 2020, so that the proper RES integration poses continent-wide challenges.\nThe Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES), and particularly the Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), is a promising technology enabling on-site storage of RES energy during periods of high generation and its use at peak grid demand. Thus, CES acts as Grid Energy Storage (GES), where cryogen is boiled to drive a turbine and to restore electricity to the grid. To date, CES applications have been rather limited by the poor round trip efficiency (ratio between energies spent for and retrieved from energy storage) due to unrecovered energy losses.\nThe CryoHub project is therefore designed to maximise the CES efficiency by recovering energy from cooling and heating in a perfect RES-driven cycle of cryogen liquefaction, storage, distribution and efficient use. Refrigerated warehouses for chilled and frozen food commodities are large electricity consumers, possess powerful installed capacities for cooling and heating and waste substantial amounts of heat. Such facilities provide the ideal industrial environment to advance and demonstrate the LAES benefits.\nCryoHub will thus resolve most of the above-mentioned problems at one go, thereby paving the way for broader market prospects for CES-based technologies across Europe.", 161815.0, 7186916.0, "CryoHub", null, null, null, null, "http://www.bham.ac.uk", null, "h2020_199618_999907526"], ["2TT", "Topological Light at Structured Surfaces", "The University of Birmingham", "By using metamaterials and metasurfaces as the platform, this proposal focuses on the novel topological physics and applications introduced by Berry phase.

This is most likely related to the physicochemical properties of the ENMs but the current understanding is limited and inconclusive, primarily due to limited or irreproducible characterisation of ENMs. Therefore, a systematic investigation on the BBB-penetrating ability and association with the intrinsic properties of ENMs is urgently needed. (2) What is the fate of ENMs within and beyond the BBB? i.e. the deposition, translocation, and transformation of ENMs after crossing the BBB. Given that the accumulation of ENMs in BBB might be low, localizing the ENMs in the system would be a challenging task, especially for ENMs with high elemental backgrounds (e.g., C-based and Fe-based ENMs). Thus, novel approaches are urgently needed to enable a breakthrough in our understanding of ENM ability to cross the BBB and trace their path beyond. Project NanoBBB proposes combining novel labelling techniques with an on-a-chip brain model and in vivo experiments enabling a uniquely novel approach to solve this problem. This project will allow us to systematically understand the behaviour and fate of certain ENMs in brain and contribute to safer design of ENMs. The ER brings her extensive biological expertise to the host lab, which in turn offers world-class analytical and labelling facilities and expertise. NanoBBB also offers placements in industry for the on-a-chip technology development and an NGO to host the in-vivo experiments enabling validation of the model.", 170373.0, 170373.0, "NanoBBB", null, null, null, null, "http://www.bham.ac.uk", null, "h2020_215649_999907526"], ["2TT", "Extremal Combinatorics: existence, counting and typical structure", "The University of Birmingham", "A central theme of extremal combinatorics is the interplay and relationship between the parameters of combinatorial objects.

The molecular strategies land plants use to respond to submergence vary widely between species and are not fully understood due to lack of model organisms naturally adapted to such multiple stresses. SUBTOL takes a completely new approach to improving plant submergence tolerance: harnessing genetic mechanisms from green seaweeds, a group of organisms naturally adapted to both submergence and desiccation, for which there is no equivalent terrestrial counterpart. SUBTOL will use the emerging model green seaweed Ulva to understand the changes in gene regulation that occur during seaweed submergence and exposure. Ulva shares a common ancestor with land plants and is uniquely adapted to natural periodic submergence/exposure cycles arising from tides. SUBTOL sets a new research paradigm and will define for the first time the molecular mechanisms regulating both submergence and post-submergence stress in a seaweed. This data will then be used to manipulate relevant genes in land plants, to modify their submergence tolerance via a synthetic biology approach. SUBTOL will thus generate knowledge benefiting both academia and industry.

Howard sought not only to reform architectural design, but also to effect social change through facilitating new forms of communal living, including the role of women. Soon after, the first garden cities were built in Britain. It is generally accepted that the visions of British thinkers and designers such as Howard was influential in central Europe.

Its main focus is on the Czech and Slovak lands (part of Austria-Hungary before 1918, afterwards, Czechoslovakia), but it also makes comparative reference to Austria and Germany.

Whether the size of this sink will persist, intensify, decrease or even become a source is highly uncertain, yet knowing this is crucial to the calculation of carbon emission budgets consistent with limiting global temperature rise. One of the most compelling explanations for this uncertainty is a lack of knowledge of how tree mortality affects forest carbon storage on a global scale. Mortality rates and mechanisms are closely tied to forest structure and composition, and thus the storage of carbon in biomass, but mechanistic complexity and the difficulty of measurement have hindered understanding, resulting in a striking lack of consensus in existing assessments. TreeMort will remedy this, combining newly available sources of data with appropriate conceptualisation and innovative modelling, to provide quantifications of the rates and causes of tree death, and their relation to environmental drivers, that set new standards for robustness, comprehensiveness and consistency at the global scale. This breaking-out of the narrower foci of previous work will be a game-changer, finally enabling globally-comprehensive investigation of the extent to which whole forest structure and function are governed by and interact with mortality, and their likely evolution under environmental change. TreeMort will assess this using state-of-the-art ecosystem modelling, which will then be employed to make a fundamental reassessment of the current and future carbon storage capacity of global forests. TreeMort will thus bring us significantly closer to understanding fully how forests interact with the global carbon cycle, assisting efforts to mitigate climate change.", 1182107.0, 1301610.0, "TreeMort", null, null, null, null, "http://www.bham.ac.uk", null, "h2020_212199_999907526"], ["2TT", "Non-Conventional Wave Propagation for Future Sensing and Actuating Technologies", "The University of Birmingham", "New sensing devices and technologies are the key in addressing numerous challenges that agriculture is facing today.

Organocatalysed ROP produces polymers that are free of residual metal contaminates but to date, does not allow high productivities with high levels of stereocontrol.

Reflecting this view, current neurocognitive studies focus on isolating static snapshots of past events in an individual's pattern of brain activity. This snapshot approach, however, ignores the reconstructive and dynamic nature of the retrieval process, necessarily limiting our understanding of human memory. The vision behind STREAM is to advance the field beyond its current state of the art by mapping the spatiotemporal dynamics of mnemonic reconstruction in the human brain. The research programme contains three work packages that support this vision at multiple levels of investigation, from combined electrophysiological and hemodynamic activity down to neuronal assembly firing patterns in the human hippocampus. These techniques are used in combination with paradigms that decompose memories into their constituent elements, and track the neural representations of these elements as they unfold in time and space when an event is reconstructed from memory. So far, it has been difficult to integrate information obtained by these various recording techniques. STREAM will use an innovative representational mapping approach that combines spatiotemporal information at the level of an individual's neural representational architecture. This approach enables us to directly map memory patterns emerging at a given time point onto a given brain region.

At the cellular level, AR is caused by an impaired activation of the protein kinase mTORC1, which in turn blunts protein synthetic responses to anabolic stimuli. Lysosomal trafficking is critical for the full activation of mTORC1, with the blocking of this event creating anabolic resistance in otherwise healthy cells. However, to date, this phenomenon has not been examined in human skeletal muscle. Therefore, our working hypothesis is that alterations in lysosomal trafficking may be an underlying mechanism to explain impaired mTORC1 activity and AR in elderly individuals. To address this hypothesis, we will define, for the first time, the role and regulation of lysosomal trafficking in age-associated AR in human skeletal muscle. \n\nThrough a combination of in-vitro and in vivo studies we will examine (1) whether genetic induction of lysosomal trafficking can activate mTORC1 and overcome chemical/nutrient induced AR in human primary myotubes, (2) whether genetic knockdown of proteins that stimulate lysosomal trafficking can inhibit mTORC1 activity and cause AR, and (3) examine whether lysosomal trafficking differs between young and elderly subjects, in vivo, in response to anabolic stimuli such as amino acids and resistance exercise.\n\nThe importance of this work should not be understated, given that the number of individuals aged over 60 and 80 years is expected to triple and quadruple respectively by 2050.

Therefore, a conundrum exists as to how oscillations code episodic memory. The aim of this project is to propose and test a new framework that has the potential to reconcile this conflict. The central idea is that synchronization and desynchronization cooperatively code episodic memories, with synchronized activity in the hippocampus in the theta (~4 Hz) and gamma (~ 40-60 Hz) frequency range mediating the building of associations, and neocortical desynchronization in the alpha (~10 Hz) and beta (~15 Hz) frequency range mediating the representation of mnemonic information. Importantly the two modules, with their respective synchronous/asynchronous behaviours, must interact during the formation and retrieval of episodic memories, but how and whether this is the case remains untested to date.  I will test these fundamental questions using a multidisciplinary and multi-method approach, including human single cell recordings, neuroimaging, brain stimulation, and computational modelling. The results from these experiments have the potential to reveal the neural code that human episodic memory is based on, which is still one of the biggest mysteries of the human mind.", 1618042.0, 1618042.0, "Code4Memory", null, null, null, null, "http://www.bham.ac.uk", null, "h2020_198627_999907526"], ["2TT", "Pathways Regulating Intramyocellular Insulin Sensitivity and Metabolism in Health and Disease", "The University of Birmingham", "Currently, there is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis underpinning insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), due to their dramatically increasing prevalence.

DKD is associated with greatly increased mortality and frequently progresses to end stage renal failure. Pharmacotherapy, dialysis and transplantation represent the mainstay treatments for DKD but are costly and provide only limited protection against adverse outcomes. Mesenchymal Stromal Cell (MSC) therapy is a promising approach to halting the progression of DKD toward end-stage renal failure and may also have ancillary\nbenefits in Type 2 diabetes. In preliminary research, we have demonstrated that a single dose of MSC simultaneously improves kidney function (glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria) as well as hyperglycaemia in animals with DKD. NEPHSTROM will conduct a multi-centre, placebo-controlled clinical trial of a novel MSC therapy for stabilization of progressive DKD, leading to superior clinical outcomes and long-term socioeconomic benefit. A\nkey enabler for this trial is a novel MSC population (CD362\\MSC, trade name ORBCEL-M) which delivers higher purity and improved characterisation compared to conventional plastic-adherent MSC. The NEPHSTROM Phase 1b/2a clinical trial will investigate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of a single intravenous infusion of allogeneic ORBCEL-M versus placebo in adults with progressive DKD.

The growing influence of climate change on European rivers means that fluvial organisms are increasingly threatened by high temperatures, and temperature-driven declines in fish populations are already being observed across Europe. Despite this, ecosystems in certain rivers are resilient to climate change due to the presence of alternating warm and cool habitats. Rivers with high thermal habitat heterogeneity will therefore be increasingly important in sustaining fluvial biodiversity in areas affected by climate change, and a better insight into the drivers of river temperature heterogeneity is essential. However, little is currently known about the spatio-temporal variability of river temperature heterogeneity, and understanding both the nature of this variability and its fundamental driving processes remains a key problem in the river sciences. In light of this, the aim of HoTRiverS is to quantify the spatial and temporal scales of thermal heterogeneity in UK rivers and to infer the controls and processes driving these space-time patterns. This research theme will be addressed following four key objectives: 1. Quantify variability in temperature heterogeneity across the UK using thermal infrared remote sensing. 2. Attribute observed patterns of heterogeneity to key landscape properties using a spatial statistical network model approach. 3. Understand how these landscape properties drive water temperature heterogeneity through using deterministic water temperature models to analyse the energy transfers associated with different landscape types. 4. Explore the sensitivity of river temperature heterogeneity to change by modelling future climate and land-use change scenarios.

Together, we will identify and integrate the main drivers of prevalent and incident AF in patients, and validate new ECG- and blood based markers in well-characterized cohorts. The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia.
