Based on field observations, experimental data and models, it establishes new flux, concentration and dose-response relationships, as a basis to inform future European policies.\n\nStarting with biosphere-atmosphere exchange measurements, \u00c9CLAIRE quantifies how global warming and altered precipitation will affect emissions of key European primary pollutants (NOx, NH3, VOCs), including interactions with increasing aerosol and hemispheric O3 background concentrations, modifying atmospheric transport and deposition. An ensemble of chemistry transport models will be applied to assess uncertainty in response to harmonized scenarios for climate, emissions and land-use, while high resolution studies will investigate how climate change alters local patterns of pollutant exposure and threshold exceedance.\n\nA network of European experiments for contrasting ecosystems and climates, combined with meta-analysis of unpublished datasets, will quantify how climate change alters ecosystem vulnerability to tropospheric O3 and N deposition, including interaction with increased CO2. Combined with special topics on interactions with N form (wet/dry, NHx/NOy), aerosol-exacerbated drought stress and BVOC self-protection of O3 effects, novel threshold and dose-response approaches will be developed. These will be combined with regional atmospheric and biogeochemical models to estimate interactions and feedbacks on plant/soil carbon stocks, greenhouse gas balance and plant species change.\n\nThe new risk assessment chain to be developed will be applied at the European scale, quantifying how projected climate change will alter damage estimates. Combined with economic valuation of ecosystem services, improved integrated assessment modelling will allow a cost-benefit analysis to inform future mitigation and adaptation strategies on air pollution and climate change.", 64655.0, 8835063.0, "ECLAIRE", "Climate change and air pollution", "A Europe-wide study on air pollution impacts on ecosystems under changing climate conditions has developed a series of large-scale models and data sets. The EU-funded initiative shows that nitrogen and ozone pollution interact to affect plant productivity, plant community composition and carbon storage, with climate warming expected to exacerbate the adverse pollution impacts.", "The project http://www.eclaire-fp7.eu (ECLAIRE) (Effects of climate change on air pollution impacts and response strategies for European ecosystems) is investigating how the climate, ecosystems and the atmosphere interact and how this affects ecosystems. The work is based on field observations and laboratory experiments carried out with the aid of models ranging from plot to European scales.\n\nECLAIRE is working on improving computer models describing exchanges between and surface and atmosphere by accounting for important components in the European ecosystems. Flux measurements in soil for nitric oxide (NO), ozone (O3), ammonia (NH3) and biogenic (meaning a substance produced by life processes) volatile organic compounds have been made and are now interpreted to better understand their climate interactions.\n\nSeveral models are being tested and developed to predict the role of biogenic emissions in air pollution and climate at the European and global scales. Data mining was carried out to assess and develop existing models for a range of ecosystem types. Key parameters were identified and protocols developed for collecting data from ECLAIRE experiments.\n\nGlobal dynamic soil and vegetation models were created that account for effects of O3 exposure and nitrogen deposition on productivity. A forest model was also developed for conducting rapid assessments of air quality and climate change interactions. Researchers carried out the preliminary mapping of ozone dose thresholds for forests, and modelled all changes in various parameters affecting carbon sequestration in forests.\n\nThe project will therefore contribute to related knowledge generation, a strengthened European Research Area (ERA) and the integration of information for the development of future European policies. This in turn will impact on the three societal challenges identified by the EU: climate change, energy security and food security.\n\nECLAIRE will provide a European-wide quantification of how climate change is altering the threat of air pollution on ecosystems and soils. It will also quantify how, in return, pollutant effects on ecosystems influence terrestrial carbon stocks.\n\n ECLAIRE shows more clearly how climate change will affect the impact of air pollutants on crop yields, especially crop loss due to tropospheric O3 identifying novel interactions with nitrogen. The initiative finds that higher O3 levels reduce crop N use efficiency, with the implication that O3 pollution will worsen both nitrate water pollution and nitrous oxide emissions.\n\nAt the same time ECLAIRE is revealing how agricultural NH3 emission can be expected to increase under a warmer climate, thereby exacerbating this major loss of fertiliser nitrogen. This finding highlights the need for European NH3 emission controls if air quality objectives for particulate matter (PM) and Habitats protection goals for nitrogen deposition should be achieved under future climate conditions.", "http://www.eclaire-fp7.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2015-09/158922.jpg", "fp7_100135_974560456"]]}}, "outwardCode": "RG8"}
