Titanium is important material in the manufacture of new components in many important industries, including aerospace.    An automated phased array, ultrasonic NDT method supported with eddy current technology, integrated with the manufacturing process. Currently, beam steering techniques require prior knowledge of the exact geometry and acoustic properties of the material and also require an extremely precise alignment of the probe to the component under test.  The QualiTi Consortium SMEs will develop inspection of titanium at the component manufacturing stage.  The QualiTi work programme is broken down logically into work packages and includes RTD work, management, training, dissemination and knowledge management activities. The QualiTi Consortium are suited and committed to the tasks allocated to them, are able to achieve their S&T objectives and commercialise the deliverables.    The SME proposers consider that the QualiTi system will provide sufficient competitive advantage to enable annual growth rates of at least 20% in SME sales turnover over the four years following project completion. The exploitable prototype systems developed in QualiTi will reduce world spending on inspection in the aerospace market by >10% and thus generate savings of approximately \u20ac66m worldwide per annum four year after project end. The corresponding European saving is \u20ac19m.  After outsourcing research the QualiTi SMEs will become more competitive.  All the QualiTi deliverables are patentable. The QualiTi project will deliver an integrated inspection solution, to meet the requirements of the titanium aerospace industry.

Sensors capable of detecting directional force and temperature will be developed since a combination of these modalities is critical to the affective component of the neurophysiological response evoked in taction. This next generation of sensors will include NEMS arrays and hybrid bio-NEMS systems. They will be integrated into a robotic finger with articulation controlled by neural network information processing that will allow artificial exploration of a surface to be achieved in ways that mimic human haptic behaviour and affective response. The impact of the project will include alleviating the effects of human touch and vision disabilities, improving the quality of life, security printing, brand protection, smart packaging, space exploration and also the evaluation of products such as textiles and skin creams using the instrumented robotic finger.

It is also a fundamental component of emotional response witnessed in the pleasure derived from a gentle stroke, a warm hug or even a soft blanket. European scientists conducted a multidisciplinary investigation of the way the human body perceives touch with a focus on tissue-engineered nanobiosensors.\n\nIn the context of the EU-funded project NANOBIOTOUCH, the team studied affective touch (related to an emotional response) mediated by the human finger pad. They applied numerous advanced experimental methods requiring development of a dedicated dynamic platform for tactile stimulation and temperature control.\n\nThe protocols enabled researchers to acquire biophysical and psychophysical data related to all levels of the human body's response to touching different textures. Scientists gained important insight from microneurography of individual touch receptors in the finger pad all the way up to a subject's reported sense of pleasantness after touching a sample.\n\nExperiments also intertwined different levels \u2014 for example, nervous activity with perception through direct electrical stimulation of sensory neurons and subsequent reported feelings of subjects.\n\nThe team carefully and comprehensively developed a deeper understanding of the neurological coding mechanisms of tactile information, modelled them in biological and artificial systems, and developed a biomimetic robotic finger that can explore and assess the pleasing nature of an object. Hybrids are all the rage now and NANOBIOTOUCH delivered its own version, integrating real neuronal cells into a tactile biohybrid sensor.\n\nNANOBIOTOUCH outcomes have been widely disseminated through numerous publications and conference presentations, and work has resulted in numerous patents.

The nomination of Mrs Pitrat, director in charge of the professional training and teacher of non-linguistic discipline at Marlioz Vocational school boosted the European project on the sections dealing with the tertiary sector. With her partner Testenglish and the Surrey Language Center in Farnham, she had a successful experience in Paris with her fully financed ERASMUS+ program.\r\nOur institution is a regional highschool offering a general, technological, and vocational education to about 1200 teenagers. The vocational school proposes a BTEC National in Management and administration, in Trade, in Client and User Relations, and a Professional Vocational Certificate in Catering. Our three BTECs have an English European section. We want that 10 of our students have a 4 week internship abroad each year. The common professional mobility of these two classes would be ensured.\r\nProfessional training throughout life and being open to the E.U. are part of Marlioz project, a strong image that we have been developing for years now. Students apply in these classes to take part to a European teaching program. Our open day, our work with middle schools, our short internships promote this program.\r\nThese future trainees will do the common tasks in management, administration, trade, client and user relations that compose a three year curriculum and will discover a country, a culture, a language and new skills in relation to their future work but different from their usual practices.\r\n\r\nIn the  program girls are on par with boys. The number of students is from 12 to 15. Each student has a distinct profile if we consider the professional skills to develop, the wish to continue to study and the professional integration.\r\nThey are motivated and realize the importance of being open to the E.U. for the trade or for an administrative position. They are aware that it is an undeniable opportunity to be differentiated in the professional world that is European or even more international.\r\nOnce in Fifth year, they participate to European activities. They have a two- hour lesson of Non-linguistic discipline including one hour of co-teaching: vocational teaching in English to gain specialized vocational vocabulary. A Californian English assistant works with them and helps them to pass the Cambridge Certificate. To prepare them to this mobility (a visit and a discovery  of the European institutions in Strasbourg are incorporated). A five day school trip to London allows them to see a European capital. We set up the visit of a school or a company that will offer an overview on the English educational and professional practices. As the principal goal of this mobility is contextual we have a project of comparison of the tourist attractiveness of the city of Aix le Bains and the city of Galway.\r\nWhile in Galway and during 5 days, they will have a pedagogical, linguistic and cultural preparation. First, Testenglish, will gather the students according to their level and integrate them to the right group for the best progress.\r\nDays are spent on the integration in companies. The supervisors are aware of their role with the trainees. They are ready to help the students to get skills and improve their English. Our students discover the E.U. and its mobilities, Galway, a small town where students enhance their English and learn more. Testenglish covers the accommodation and the work placement for all participants who quickly meet other European students. In Cork, Amazon takes care of the participants.\r\nApart from the need to do an internship abroad to validate the European mention and the Europass formation, it is also to give them the opportunity to discover Europe and the English language in a country, in a school at the crossroads of several cultures. They mix in with students that pursue higher education and come back with a strengthened motivation. Discomfort, because their families are not nearby, makes them surpass themselves. They all try to show themselves at their best and come back mature and ready to leave again.

With a struggling public, high percentage of drop outs pupils our school needs to innovate in stays by offering an intercultural openness which is a huge asset for students.  Most students attend our classes by obligation or because they had no other offers.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, the school opened a double European section in English and Spanish to welcome students for the administrative B-tech National .  This class, as well as those that followed proved that the students enrolled in this section were highly motivated : \r\nOur school wants to expand the training offer. The new European section in English will allow our students to benefit from mobility abroad. This is to increase  their motivation. At the beginning of 2015 the high school saw the opening of a European trade section.\r\n\r\nMore recently, at the beginning of 2015 the school saw the opening of a European trade section.The school also participates in various dynamic projects focused on the European union.

Previously,  The Centre International d\u2019Etudes P\u00e9dagogiques (CIEP) selected our school for a partnership with Kingsbrook business \r\nand enterprise school, in UK. http://www.kingsbrook.org.uk/.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2010-2011 academic year, a virtual exchange via e-learning took place. It was helpful as it enabled students in their first year in B-Tech National to introduce their professional projects to their British counterparts, once a month.\r\nBetween 2011 and 2013, a B-Tech National class specializing in security went to Auschwitz  aim of understanding the importance of memory and remembrance. Another class went to Dachau. This experience was successfully renewed in November 2016. Professional experience and awareness of European culture are at the heart of the training given to our students.\r\n One teacher has been a adviser  for the European and international issues (ERAI) since 2010. He acts as a liaison between the international partners, the funding agencies and the DAREIC (School representative for European and international relations)   of the Paris Academy.\r\nIn order to reinforce our commitment to the European culture, we consider it essential that our students enrolled in the Administrative, commercial and security service sector  should do part of their training periods in one or more European countries.\r\nA work experience abroad would be a success factor for our students from disadvantaged backgrounds. This allows our trainees to participate in enriching learning exchanges. An undeniable axis to fight against  dropping out of school.\r\n\r\nIndeed, professional mobility and language acquisition are made a priority for our students because of the internationalization of trade. They enable the students to broaden their professional, cultural and personal horizons. They are also an asset for students wishing to further their education in a Two-Year Technical Degree, where the knowledge of languages is a real advantage.\r\nTherefore, In November 2017 and  2018, 48 students from our school should have the means to do a 5-week training period in British and Spanish companies in United Kingdom and  in Spain.\r\n\r\nTh\u00e9ophile Gautier vocational school wants to offer a new horizon to students of all sectors and not only to those of the European section.

The Polish youngsters are mainly from a native Polish background; since there is only a small number of migrants in Poland many youngsters don\u2019t have the opportunity to build relationships with those from ethnically diverse backgrounds and religious beliefs different from their own. Furthermore, both Belgian and Wales\u2019 group consist of youngsters with fewer possibilities, with several difficulties on psychological, financial, familial and societal level due to barriers they face due to their race and religious beliefs. These interesting differences between the groups of youngsters could provide a platform for perspective changing discussions and debates during the exchange. \r\n\r\nOur program for the week consists of a wide range of engaging activities using a non-formal learning methods to facilitate good relationship building among the group of young people. We will start by providing group games and workshops to encourage developing relationships and to get to know each other\u2019s cultures as well as the individual young people. During the week there will be interactive workshops and discussions based around identity, culture, religion and migration as the young people become more in touch with their own identity as well as sharing their perspectives with other young people. The young people will have the opportunity to  focus on photography as a method for young people to think about their own identity; questioning what concepts of \u2018home\u2019 and \u2018self\u2019 mean to them through expressing themselves through a visual medium. By using photography it will be a fantastic opportunity for young people to learn new skills and is also a way for all young people to communicate regardless of their language skills. Throughout these activities we plan to encourage young people to take ownership of the exchange by also leading their own activities, encouraging participation through a youth centered approach; examples of this will be young people hosting a cultural tour around their home town of Swansea.\r\n\r\nThe first main objective of the exchange is getting to know each other and other cultures. In spite of great cultural differences, youngsters will find a lot of individual similarities. Spending a week together and sharing beautiful and difficult moments, will contribute to a feeling of openness and willingless to learn from others backgrounds and experiences.  \r\n\r\nAnother main objective for the youngsters is to get to know themselves better, feel stronger and more confident, valuing their individuality and feeling empowered to share this diversity with others to break down barriers between different ethnic and religious groups. This is an important objective for all those youngsters involved in the exchange as they will be able to learn from and empower each other to celebrate difference. In a time of growing hostility towards the \u2018other\u2019 within European countries \u2013 the growth of far right sentiment and the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU unfortunately demonstrate this - our youth organisations working together can ensure young people still feel valued within Europe and feel invested in an outward looking approach, committed to being seen as a European or global citizen. \r\n\r\nThe main outcome of the exchange will be a photography exhibition that has been developed and made by the youngsters involved in the exchange. This exhibition will reflect how the youngsters see themselves and their peers. It will be shown in the three countries after the exchange, so that both younger and older people can visit and learn from these issues, importantly from a young person\u2019s perspective. Together with the youngsters, we will prepare a workshop on identity that accompanies the exhibition. The fact that the project continues after the exchange, extends the effect of it. Back at home, youngsters can show the result of the exchange and be, once more, proud of what they did.
