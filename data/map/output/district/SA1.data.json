Titanium is important material in the manufacture of new components in many important industries, including aerospace.    An automated phased array, ultrasonic NDT method supported with eddy current technology, integrated with the manufacturing process. Currently, beam steering techniques require prior knowledge of the exact geometry and acoustic properties of the material and also require an extremely precise alignment of the probe to the component under test.  The QualiTi Consortium SMEs will develop inspection of titanium at the component manufacturing stage.  The QualiTi work programme is broken down logically into work packages and includes RTD work, management, training, dissemination and knowledge management activities. The QualiTi Consortium are suited and committed to the tasks allocated to them, are able to achieve their S&T objectives and commercialise the deliverables.    The SME proposers consider that the QualiTi system will provide sufficient competitive advantage to enable annual growth rates of at least 20% in SME sales turnover over the four years following project completion. The exploitable prototype systems developed in QualiTi will reduce world spending on inspection in the aerospace market by >10% and thus generate savings of approximately \u20ac66m worldwide per annum four year after project end. The corresponding European saving is \u20ac19m.  After outsourcing research the QualiTi SMEs will become more competitive.  All the QualiTi deliverables are patentable. The QualiTi project will deliver an integrated inspection solution, to meet the requirements of the titanium aerospace industry.

This will be achieved through systematic integration of new developments from converging scientific areas by involving academic and industrial participants who are experts in cognitive sciences, microneurography, brain imaging, cell biology and mechanics, tissue engineering, skin physics (tribology and mechanics), microengineering, multi-scale multi-physics modelling, information processing, robotics, prosthetics and medical rehabilitation. The project will build on existing discriminative touch research in order to understand affective touch mediated by the human fingerpad. Sensors capable of detecting directional force and temperature will be developed since a combination of these modalities is critical to the affective component of the neurophysiological response evoked in taction. This next generation of sensors will include NEMS arrays and hybrid bio-NEMS systems. They will be integrated into a robotic finger with articulation controlled by neural network information processing that will allow artificial exploration of a surface to be achieved in ways that mimic human haptic behaviour and affective response. The impact of the project will include alleviating the effects of human touch and vision disabilities, improving the quality of life, security printing, brand protection, smart packaging, space exploration and also the evaluation of products such as textiles and skin creams using the instrumented robotic finger.

A biomimetic robotic finger could soon help individuals with various afflictions do that better, and even support quality control of products like textiles for which a pleasing touch counts.", "Touch tells us whether something is slippery, rough or fuzzy, enables the visually impaired to read Braille and is critical to numerous everyday tasks. It is also a fundamental component of emotional response witnessed in the pleasure derived from a gentle stroke, a warm hug or even a soft blanket. European scientists conducted a multidisciplinary investigation of the way the human body perceives touch with a focus on tissue-engineered nanobiosensors.\n\nIn the context of the EU-funded project NANOBIOTOUCH, the team studied affective touch (related to an emotional response) mediated by the human finger pad. They applied numerous advanced experimental methods requiring development of a dedicated dynamic platform for tactile stimulation and temperature control.\n\nThe protocols enabled researchers to acquire biophysical and psychophysical data related to all levels of the human body's response to touching different textures. Scientists gained important insight from microneurography of individual touch receptors in the finger pad all the way up to a subject's reported sense of pleasantness after touching a sample.\n\nExperiments also intertwined different levels \u2014 for example, nervous activity with perception through direct electrical stimulation of sensory neurons and subsequent reported feelings of subjects.\n\nThe team carefully and comprehensively developed a deeper understanding of the neurological coding mechanisms of tactile information, modelled them in biological and artificial systems, and developed a biomimetic robotic finger that can explore and assess the pleasing nature of an object. Hybrids are all the rage now and NANOBIOTOUCH delivered its own version, integrating real neuronal cells into a tactile biohybrid sensor.\n\nNANOBIOTOUCH outcomes have been widely disseminated through numerous publications and conference presentations, and work has resulted in numerous patents. Applications range from enhancing the quality of life of those with impaired touch and vision to robotic exploration of textiles and creams to brand protection.
