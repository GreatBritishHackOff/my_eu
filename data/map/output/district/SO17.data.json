There are currently over 6 million people with dementia in the European Union (EU). The increasingly ageing population makes AD an economic and social burden for our society, thus investigating the pathological mechanisms of AD and the characterization of the pharmacological targets are research priorities. Aggregation of amyloid-Beta (A\u03b2), upstream of tau phosphorylation, is considered a driving force in AD pathogenesis, and the major target of the clinical trials of immunotherapy. The first clinical trial at Southampton University (UoS) showed A\u03b2 removal but also reduced phospho-tau, supporting a link between these proteins. Similar evidence emerged in bigenic tau/A\u03b2 Drosophila, a neurodegeneration model. During ageing in humans, the molecules of AD pathogenesis undergo ageing processes resulting in amino acid modifications that influence protein folding, functionality and interactions. Specially, pyroglutamate-modi\ufb01ed A\u03b2 (pEA\u03b2) seems to be a key participant in AD pathology. Accordingly, the identification of markers of protein ageing is important to comprehend AD pathogenesis with relevance in therapies.

Past regime shifts in marine ecosystems such as observed in 1977 and in 1998 in the North Pacific in several trophic levels challenged the marine resources managers because of the scale (throughout the North Pacific) and the abruptness (occurred within a year or so) of the change. For example, after the 1998 regime shift in the western North Pacific, herring, capelin and anchovy replaced the previously dominant Japanese sardine. In marine ecosystems, abrupt changes can be induced by climate variability or can also be generated randomly from within the system. Abrupt changes can also be triggered when the system responds in a gradual way to forcing until it crosses some threshold, after which it rapidly transitions to a new state. Since regime shifts may be detectable earlier in marine plankton than in upper trophic levels, this project aims to investigate the presence of abrupt changes in time series of marine phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and to identify the physical mechanisms responsible for inducing abrupt changes.

The contacts ensure electron transport, hydrogen transport and O2 influx.

Controlled delivery of suitable positive additives including antimitotic factors will be aimed for and their release monitored.

Cavitation of ship propellers has been identified as a main source of this background noise. The EU requires Member States to demonstrate that levels of underwater noise do not harm marine life. It is believed that cavitation noise from shipping traffic is largely responsible for low frequency ambient noise,a need has arisen for an improved understanding of the correlation between cavitation and background noise in the seas.\nThe EU has set out on improving the environment within its member states by adopting the Good Environmental Status. This has been further defined in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, in which it describes descriptors for measuring the environmental status. One of these descriptors is the underwater noise linked to among others maritime transport. It is stated that the reduction of underwater noise will be a measure for the improvement of the environment.

It rotates at slow speeds and operates under atmospheric pressure with a continuous bed, thus minimising negative impact on fish and allowing for unhindered sediment and fish passage. Initial work indicated significant development potential, whilst the expected structural simplicity promises increased cost effectiveness. Three configurations will be investigated for different applications in rivers with a head difference, for free stream situations and for energy generation in water supply systems. The configurations will be optimised using a combination of small and large scale model tests, theoretical and numerical modelling. The ecological impact will be assessed at every step of development, and fed back into the R/D process to achieve an ecologically effective design. In the absence of appropriate testing facilities, large scale tests will be conducted in natural rivers scenarios, adding to the realism of environmental impact assessment.

Therefore, the development of computational methods for crystal structure prediction (CSP) from first principles has been a goal of computational chemistry that could significantly accelerate the design of new materials.

The EU-funded 'Noise impact of aircraft with novel engine configurations in mid- to high altitude operations' (NINHA) project was initiated to extend these studies. Scientists sought to scientifically evaluate en route noise issues (during mid- to high-altitude operation) associated with novel CROR systems.\n\nOne major challenge for researchers was to validate the long-range noise propagation models at cruising altitudes. To this end, they performed near- and far-field measurements of noise attenuation between a propeller aircraft with a conventional engine and the ground. These measurements matched those of the prediction models that also involved locally varying atmospheric conditions.\n\nAnother major challenge was to extrapolate near-field CROR noise, measured in wind tunnels, to the far-field. Researchers applied two computational aero-acoustics methods to produce a comprehensive database for the far-field. The source noise and propagation models were implemented in the SOPRANO aircraft noise prediction software suite to predict en route noise levels as perceived on the ground.\n\nResearchers also developed an en route noise impact model. Noise data for turbofans, turboprops and CROR aircraft were obtained from the EASA BANOERAC study, NINHA dedicated measurements and SOPRANO predictions, respectively. Combined with en route air traffic data generated in NINHA, the en route noise impact was established for various aircraft and engine configurations (CROR share). Based on the impact calculation results, researchers made a first assessment regarding the challenges the new-generation CROR aircraft may face.\n\nNINHA established that at cruising altitudes the CROR noise with current technology is expected to be significantly reduced compared to that of the unducted fan of the 1980s. The maximum cruise noise level should be equivalent to that of today's turboprops.

Moreover, during neurodegeneration and inflammation, the mechanisms that control neural stem cell biology are altered and may also affect disease progression, causing impaired neural stem cell renewal, migration and differentiation. Since these proliferative responses are both involved in neurodegeneration they may share common or perhaps antagonistic regulatory pathways.\nIn this project, using a tractable laboratory model of neurodegeneration (murine prion disease), we will study the time-course and molecular regulation of microglial and neural stem cell proliferative responses.

The unusual properties of the polaritons make them a unique laboratory for study of fundamental quantum effects such as high temperature Bose Einstein condensation, superfluidity, entanglement etc. The important property of the polaritonic systems is their polarization (spin) properties.

The project worked not only on lowering noise levels but on improving the characteristics and signatures of the noise. \n\nTo achieve its aims, the project team synthesised the sounds of an aeroplane flying overhead to understand aircraft noise and develop effective tools to be used in minimising annoyance for communities near airports. It worked with aircraft sound designers, noise engineers and noise effects experts, in addition to integrating research from academia, industry and the health sector. COSMA considered how the sound of future flyovers could be lessened and investigated the potential for annoyance reduction. \n\nMore specifically, the project developed techniques to model the impact of aircraft noise on communities around airports. It created a database of noise including take-off and landing events for different aircraft, and developed a tool to generate sound files from recordings or simulations. Several other related databases and tools were also developed to further research and development on the topic, including the Aviation Noise Impact Knowledge Base and Exchange Mechanism (ANIKBEM). \n\nThe dedicated sound engineering tool developed enables accurate synthesis and analysis of aircraft flyover noise events in airport communities.

Given the growing number of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) in the development pipeline, the market is poised for rapid advancement with the delivery of appropriate micro-power supplies.\n\nScientists initiated the EU-funded 'Superior energy and power density Li-ion microbatteries' (Superlion) project to develop solutions for this bottleneck to progress. Nanomaterials, with interesting functional properties related to their very small scales, offer new resources with which to address the issue. The Superlion team explored synthesis and fabrication of novel nano-structured battery materials and microbattery (MB) components. The goal is to develop three-dimensional microbatteries (3D-MBs) with at least 10 times better energy density per footprint area relative to comparable planar 2D thin-film batteries. In addition, scientists are exploring whether related techniques can improve the performance of conventional Li-ion batteries (LIBs).\n\nWork focused on nanomaterials for electrodes and electrolytes as well as novel process technologies for MB fabrication, leading to the development of rechargeable 3D-MBs for MEMS and medical applications. Numerous advances were related to deposition of electrode materials as controlled films on nano-structured current collectors. Many variations of electrode materials and deposition/manufacturing processes were investigated with good capacity (charge storage) retention over numerous cycles. In particular, manganese oxide (MnO2) half-cells demonstrated capacities up to 200 times greater than that of comparable planar (2D) electrodes. Several 3D-MB cells were developed and fabricated.\n\nAn industrial phase was aimed at delivering proof-of-concept. Three test-cell types were chosen for evaluation: a Li iron phosphate (LiFePO4)-based cell, a flexible flat cell and two rechargeable Li-button or Li-coin cells (MC614 and V500). Energy density and size characteristics were particularly promising. With enhanced electrochemical performance, they could be applicable to a wide range of future MEMS and medical devices.\n\nSuperlion has made important advances in the development of rechargeable 3D-MBs of direct impact on numerous microelectronic devices including microsensor arrays, identification cards, pacemakers/defibrillators and drug delivery systems.

GTSNEXT also analysed Monte dei Corvi (Italy) and deep-sea (equatorial Atlantic) cores, further refining the GST to account for prehistoric impacts of tides and astronomic pull.\n\nGTSNEXT has thereby produced the first calculations describing how extraterrestrial gravity and tidal forces affected Miocene climate change.\nFinally, GTSNEXT honed the isotope dating techniques and accepted ratios for fields such as uranium-lead geochronology and cosmochronology.\n\nGTSNEXT has expanded and refined the GST dating back 100 million years, a novel contribution which the consortium expects to stand undisputed.

However, in the last decade there has been a rise in pertussis incidence, particularly in vaccinated adolescents and adults in industrialized countries. The increased circulation of B. pertussis (Bp) constitutes a risk for transmission to vulnerable infants and older adults. Additionally, immunity in humans has been shown to wane rapidly after immunization with pertussis vaccines, especially with acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines, suggesting that the improved reactogenicity profile of aP compared to whole cell pertussis vaccines, may be accompanied by differences in duration of immunity. The key objectives of PERISCOPE are to 1. identify biomarkers of protection against Bp colonization and disease; 2. foster scientific innovation and rebuild the ecosystem and technical infrastructure needed in Europe to allow the future evaluation of novel pertussis vaccine candidates and 3. improve understanding of the pathogenesis of Bp infection and its potential impact on the recently observed changes in pertussis epidemiology. To reach these objectives, PERISCOPE brings together a selected group of internationally recognized public and EFPIA partners with strong expertise in clinical trials, immunology, molecular microbiology, human and animal challenge models and bioinformatics. We will initiate a series of (pre)clinical studies and develop harmonized human and animal challenge models, standardized assays and cutting-edge techniques to unravel the innate and adaptive responses to Bp.

Most importantly, the aforementioned projects and surveys highlight that current repair and strengthening methods are costly and time-consuming and result in large socio-economic losses due to disruption of traffic flow such as travel delays, longer travel distances, insufficient move of goods, and loss of business. Therefore, bridge owners and bridge engineers urgently seek to transfer into real-life projects more efficient and less disruptive methods for bridge repair, strengthening and maintenance. External post-tensioning is recognised as a powerful technique in the rehabilitation of existing bridges as well as in the construction of new bridges. For the advantages of noncorrosive property and high strength, fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are being increasingly used for external tendons instead of conventional steel ones. Existing research on externally prestressed steel-concrete composite bridges has focused on the short-term loading. However, the inevitable loss of long-term performance of prestressed composite bridges is of primary concern in practice, especially when FRP tendons are used. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate deeply the long-term behaviour of these bridges and, on this basis, to propose practical design guidelines.

The challenge therefore remains - how do we reliably map such relationships between multiple ES, thereby enabling multifunctional, ES-based management of our landscapes?\n\nIn the SCALEFORES project, I will address this challenge head-on by developing and testing a novel methodological framework that enables the use of existing data to produce accurate maps of the relationships between ES in previously unmapped regions.  The overarching idea underpinning SCALEFORES is that we can use information on the scale-dependency of relationships between existing social and ecological datasets (e.g. land cover, soil type, human population density) to create maps of trade-offs and win-wins between ecosystem services. \n\nThe SCALEFORES project will systematically examine the scale-dependency of relationships between ecosystem services and the social and ecological variables that underpin them. It will then use this knowledge to enable a step change increase in our ability to accurately map both relationships between ES and the distributions of ecosystem services themselves.

The specific science questions I will address with these techniques are: (1) how does the soil around the root, the rhizosphere, function and influence the soil ecosystems at multiple scales, (2) what is the role of root-soil interface micro morphology and mycorrhizae on plant nutrient uptake, (3) what is the effect of plant exuded mucilage on the soil morphology, mechanics and resulting field and ecosystem scale soil function and (4) how to translate this knowledge from the single root scale to root system, field and ecosystem scale in order to predict how the climate change, different soil management strategies and plant breeding will influence the soil fertility.", 1697486.0, 1697486.0, "DIMR", null, null, null, null, "http://www.southampton.ac.uk", null, "h2020_194471_999975329"], ["1BJ", "Open Data INcubator for Europe", "University of Southampton", "The Open Data INcubator for Europe (ODINE) project will set up an environment to support and advice SMEs and start-ups in creating commercial added value from open data.

The Fellows will be trained in innovative PhD topics as well as receiving specific theoretical and practical education in the field of pass-by noise engineering, tackling as well the pass-by noise aspects of the \u2018source\u2019, the \u2018transfer path\u2019 and the \u2018receiver\u2019.\n\nPBNv2 is formed by 10 beneficiaries combining leading education institutes, top research institutions and leading companies as well as 7 partner organisations established in European automotive R&D, to assist in the dissemination and public engagement or PBNv2 results, and in providing dedicated training to enhance the entrepreneurial mind set of the ESRs. The Fellows will profit from top scientific research guidance in combination with highly relevant industrial supervision. Together these participants address the triple-I dimension of research training, being International, Interdisciplinary and Intersectoral. \n\nFurthermore, the industry will gain from the specific training of the young researchers.", 477507.0, 3131669.0, "PBNv2", null, null, null, null, "http://www.southampton.ac.uk", null, "h2020_205569_999975329"], ["1BJ", "Aging Lungs in European Cohorts", "University of Southampton", "This programme of work will advance the understanding of the combined effects of factors that cause poor lung function, respiratory disability and the development of COPD .

The main goal of the project is to develop a new interpretive infrastructure for the involved prehistoric sites, their museums and archaeological parks by using cultural heritage as a source of inspiration for contemporary arts and new technologies. The project will examine new ways of heritage interpretation to help enhance public appreciation of prehistoric cultures in all their forms and diversity. In the framework of the project we are fostering a cross-sectoral collaboration between archaeologists, museum professionals, contemporary artists and IT experts which will result in live performances and a complex Augmented and Virtual Reality based application. The live performances will be celebrations of the prehistoric cultural heritage taking the form of festivals at each site, and the application will offer a sustainable interpretive infrastructure that will develop the visitor experience.
