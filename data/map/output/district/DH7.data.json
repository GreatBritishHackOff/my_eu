In doing so they hope to raise standards of teaching and learning and become an outstanding provider of early years education.\r\nThe objectives of this course are as follows:-\r\n1. To ensure greater levels of pupil achievement by increasing the overall percentage of children achieving and good level of development by the end of Reception.  Staff will focus on narrowing the gap between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged children. They aim to rapidly develop the rate in which children develop personally, socially and emotionally.\r\n2. To build staff capacity by developing knowledge and skills, leadership capability and by nurturing talents.\r\n3. To create strong parent and community links.\r\n4. To develop an international perspective to learning.\r\nThese objectives are to be achieved by attending a LEAP course on \u2018Developing Creative Teaching Approaches in Early Years\u2019 in Bologna, Italy. The three participants will be key to implementing change and achieving these objectives. This will be done through the dissemination of their findings to early years staff, ITT, a network of local early years practitioners and parents /carers. As well using the school blog and eTwinning as a means of communication with early years providers across Europe.  \r\nThe impact of this course will be monitored and evaluated using a variety of evaluative tools. These include formative and summative assessments, self review, performance management, teacher and head teacher observations and feedback from parents and children.  \r\nAs a result of this project we envisage\r\n- A cohesive early years unit with a shared vision of respect, responsibility and community.\r\n- Practice and provision strongly influenced by renowned and highly effective international teaching approaches. \r\n- An inspired teaching staff with an appetite for learning and wider cultural awareness.\r\n- Strong, capable and resilient children, achieving highly.  \r\n- Parents and carers who are engaged in school life and their childs learning.\r\nUltimately this just the beginning for Brandon Primary School in developing an international dimension to teaching and learning. In the long-term we aim to develop international partnerships and projects across all key stages.", "http://www.brandonprimaryschool.co.uk/", "Brandon Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036338_coordinator"], ["7QP", "EuroBridge", "MOST EDUCATION COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 29006.0, "Youth Exchange Project \"EuroBridge\" will involve 3 countries organized into mixed multinational Teams, and will place different understandings of culture and plurality in dialogue with the aim of deepening engagement with issues of cultural interaction, civility, and diversity in the European and Global context.\r\n\r\nWe feel very strongly about including young people with fewer opportunities, therefore we shall organise our youth groups addressing this approach.\r\nA major expectation from all participants of this Youth Exchange is that they see themselves as representatives of their countries and part of the European Community. They will be challenged during the exchange to explore aspects of European citizenship and its values, to consider what the present state of youth affairs is and where they would like to see developments and improvements.\r\n\r\nYoung people from UK, Finland and Bulgaria will spend 8 days living and working together in Durham City, North-East of England. The project is organised around a progressive series of interactive activities that integrate every participant.\r\nAll the activities will be organized into mixed multinational groups - Team Castles, each named after famous UK castles.\r\nThe theme of the exchange, \"EuroBridge\", will give the opportunity for these young people to explore the role of collaborative international youth work, discussion and reflection on common and current European issues. \r\n\r\nWe want to carry out this Project with One Overall Objective:  to improve the intercultural dialogue, social inclusion, unity and solidarity, in particular, through this learning mobility opportunity for young Europeans.\r\n\r\nOther specific objectives of the Project are:   \r\n-to improve the level of key competences and skills of young people, including those with fewer opportunities.\r\n-to promote participation in democratic life in Europe and active citizenship\r\n-to tackle the prejudice and xenophobia \r\n-to strengthen the youth work, collaboration and creation of further youth links between the youth field and the labour market \r\nWe shall focus on quality improvements in youth work, in particular through enhanced cooperation between partner organisations in the youth field.\r\n\r\nIn advance of the exchange each group has agreed to provide information about their country, organisation or group and concerns that are in their regions.\r\nThe following issues and needs were already identified and we are seeking to address through this project:\r\na) Consideration of working with other young people from different countries (language, culture and social background differences) \r\nb) Social inclusion and solidarity.\r\nc) How to tackle the prejudice and xenophobia \r\nd) How it will be done and what resources will be needed to make it informative, interesting and valued by the other youth groups. \r\ne) How a wealth of ideas and ongoing work can be replicated and expanded to reach more youth and have a broader impact.\r\n\r\nConsequently, in non-formal ways, they will develop speaking, listening and negotiating skills as they participate. They will be encouraged to value one another's contributions which will address personal and social development. \r\nIn particular \"volunteering\" to take responsibility to plan and make a presentation to others, will contribute to the critical thinking of the participants.\r\n\r\nThe desired impacts are as follows:\r\n*The importance of valuing and continuing the international links and life long friendship established in the exchange\r\n*Strategic European and global challenges  - the importance of positive collaboration amongst the EU nations\r\n*The skills for working in a multicultural environment\r\n*Understanding of other cultures and openness to other cultures\r\n*Appreciation of gender equality\r\n\r\nImproved relations with local and international communities will be one of the significant longer term benefits.\r\nIncrease in work and study motivation, better chances in the youth employability will be another expected long term impact on the participants.", "http://www.mosteducation.co.uk", "MOST EDUCATION COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA105-046486_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DH7"}
