Each school / the schools will work in close cooperation with the DAREIC (the academic delegation dedicated to the European, international relations and cooperation). The members of the consortium regularly correspond by e-mail and phone. A shared e-mail address has been created (ce.pimen@ac-lille.fr) so that the schools could receive a quick answer either from the applicant or from the \u00ab Rectorat \u00bb (Local Education Authority)\r\n\r\nThe advantages for the students are:\r\n- An easier access to higher education or employability thanks to the Europass diploma,\r\n- Improved foreign language skills thanks to the commitment of foreign host companies,\r\n- A better professional mobility. \r\n- Encouragement for the students to take and pass the \u00ab mention Euro \u00bb (added to their vocational baccalaureate diploma).\r\n\r\nThis investment will also contribute to the standing of the schools, to the ambition of the MEL (Lille Metropole), which is  a European dimension conurbation, and to the awareness of future applicants.\r\n\r\nThe organization of an exchange day between learners and partners will enable us to draw lessons from the VET learning mobility.", "http://www.newvic.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036677_6"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["8SL", "R1H", "NEWHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL"], ["8AP", "RWK", "FIRST AVE, DAY HOSPITAL - NEWHAM"], ["8SL", "RWK", "NEWHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "E13"}
