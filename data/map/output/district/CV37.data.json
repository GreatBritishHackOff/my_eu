Involving 12 leading research groups and 5 companies from across Europe, QUANTOMICS developed, enhanced and integrated tools and technologies to study and understand the function of individual genes in the animal genome; associate the animal genome with their phenotypes and integrate genomic information into successful breeding programmes.\n\nQUANTOMICS sequenced the genomes of 18 Finnish Ayrshire and 20 Italian Brown Swiss bulls in order to develop a catalogue of millions of genetic variants in cattle, and developed a pipeline to evaluate their potential effects on animal performance. The team used a mastitis model to demonstrate how the tools work. QUANTOMICS also genotyped 2 500 crossbred commercial broiler chickens to identify specific genes that render individual birds inherently more or less resistant to avian pathogenic Escherichia coli infections, and developed a tool to select for such genes in their purebred parent lines. \n\nQuantitative and genomic tools developed by the project are comprehensive in their scope. They enable inclusion of genome-wide selection taking into account the variable number of gene copies within different individuals. Systems developed can also identify genomic features with large effects in a significant number of animals and prioritise the outcomes of identified polymorphisms.\n\nThe QUANTOMICS project thus bridged the gap between genomic variation and trait differences across a wide range of livestock. The significance to breeding regimes is a quantum leap in effectiveness, achieving the desired improvement with changes in the genome. Across Europe this stands to deliver major increases in animal yield accompanied by improvements in health and welfare.\n\nQUANTOMICS also contributed to raising the community awareness on the importance of farmed animal genome annotation.

The most commonly available renewable energy sources are hydro, biomass, PV, CSP, Wind, Geothermal & Wave power. Of  these wind is increasingly becoming cost competitive and the cost of wind turbines are dropping as volumes increase. This proposal deals with distributed energy production by small to medium wind turbines in the 10kW-100kW range, used immediately close to the point of power production\nWind energy conversion is a long standing process that has been employed for hundreds of years, but it is complicated and difficult to capture the maximum possible amount of power at any given point in time. The amount of power output from a WECS depends upon the accuracy with which the peak power points are tracked by the MPPT controller of the WECS control system regardless of the generator type.\nFor any wind turbine the maximum point of the power curve occurs at a particular rotor speed for a given wind speed. Even a small variation from this rotor speed will cause a significant decrease in the power extracted from the wind. Rotor speed, for a given wind speed, is dependent upon generator loading as well as the fluctuation in the wind speed. Power extraction strategies assess the wind conditions and then introduce control actions to adjust the turbine\u2019s rotational speed so that it will operate at the turbine\u2019s highest aerodynamic efficiency. Conversion strategies that have not been optimised can lead to significant wasted wind energy.\nThere have been many attempts to achieve maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms but these have not been successfully translated from academic studies to reliable working industrial implementations in our power range.

WEC relates to the electrical power output from a given wind speed. The process depends on the accuracy with which peak power points are tracked by a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller. Such controllers assess wind conditions and adjust the turbine speed to convert the maximum wind energy to turbine rotation. Sub-optimal conversion results in wasted wind energy.\n\nNone of the many previously attempted MPPT algorithms have been successfully translated to reliable industrial operation.
