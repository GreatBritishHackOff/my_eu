Every CCIVS biannual Plan of Action is based on this document.\r\nDuring the General Assembly in 2012, the analysis of the results achieved in regards with the WP highlighted the fact that actions were done on Peace and Human Rights by CCIVS members in the past years but lacked the network umbrella and visibility; and also underlined the need to compile the many educational materials existing on the thematic. \r\nCCIVS members during the GA 2016 voted for the continuation of the Raising Peace campaign and to turn this into a Programme which would take place every year - with training, local actions and communication elements. As a result of a Conference organised by CCIVS in 2016 and held on anti-radicalisation and violent extremism the CCIVS members upheld that the actions they implement locally are the best way to continue to try to access ' at risk' groups and to integrate them within local projects. The partners of this activity are all very active within the overall CCIVS Raising Peace programme and organise hundreds of projects each year which aim to include and provide the space for young people to participate in grassroots worthwhile projects focusing on community needs. \r\nTaking into account the situation in the world today where there is an increased divide and fear between people living in the same country, greater numbers of young people are without space for participation - we aim to break this down by training 21 young trainers from 11 different organisations specifically in the field of peace and human rights education so they may gain new skills but also tranfer this to their local communities with an intended oureach of 200 people in each locality and to provide information about this to millions via the communication surrounding the overall Raising Peace programme of which the training makes part. \r\n.\r\nThe main aim of this activity is to empower young activists with HRs and Peace education competencies necessary to\r\nrun Raising Peace activities. Participants going through this process will be invited to join the Pool of Trainers (PoT), consisting of experienced trainers in the field of HRs and Peace and to support future Raising Peace events open for the IVS movement\r\nThe sessions proposed to participants will provide an understanding of the general context of human rights, specific training skills and inspirations on how to improve the visibility of related initiatives. For this reason, the objectives of the training will be:\r\n\u2022 to consolidate participants\u2019 knowledge on Human Rights Education and on the contributions of the IVS on the promotion of Peace and human rights;\r\n\u2022 to acquire tools, methods and techniques to design and implement intercultural projects focused on human rights and Peace;\r\n\u2022 to improve teamwork skills, intercultural communication, cooperation;\r\n\u2022 to provide participants with communication tools for the promotion of their actions, initiatives and projects related to human rights and Peace\r\n\r\nTo respond to these objectives CCIVS will implement a Training for Trainers to take place in Afacan, Turkey from the 5-9 September 2018. The choice of Turkey as a host country is a way to support a region and an organisation deeply affected by recent dramatic events, which had a negative impact on the voluntary exchange and on the implementation of local projects. The number of incoming volunteers and participants in Turkey has considerably decreased over the last two years, therefore to organise the event with the CCIVS member in Turkey Gen\u00e7tur will produce a positive impact on the organisation and it will be a way to encourage other organisations to send activists and volunteers in the region.\r\n\r\nNFE methodology will be used throughout the project,  which we consider to be extremely important for integration and understanding between cultures. We will also use technology to give a real-time feedback of the results of the activities.\r\n\r\n1000+ young people in local communities will benefit from the activities implemented by the trained multipliers promoting non-violence and intercultural dialogue. Over 20 youth workers will gain new tools and expertise for their personal and professional growth and will take this back to their sending organisations. 11 Youth organisations directly involved in this project from 8 countries and 20+ institutions contacted via the communication campaign will benefit from the development of this project and from the sharing of the results. \r\nThis project is a concrete step towards intergrating young people at risk of exclusion on a local level and of raising awarness about this situation externally, the activity will provide a platform for the discussion and exchange and all information will be widely diffused and will show the important support of the E+ programme.", "http://www.vap.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-FR02-KA105-013633_5"], ["0PH", "Life across the fences", "Volunteer Action for Peace", 22512.0, "Massive migration flows triggered a severe and multifaceted crisis in Europe. Indeed, different European countries are showing opposite reactions and approaches to the issue. On the one hand the dramatic situation of the asylum seekers and migrants moved the heart of many Europeans - among them, normal citizens, associations and volunteers showed greater sensitivity than their own governments. On the other hand, a parallel flow of diffidence, hatred, and hate speech grew and displayed how easily racism and xenophobia can grow at every level of society. As a matter of fact, this is the evidence that, even in Europe, intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding together with human rights\u2019 awareness and defense are crucial and urgent priorities.\r\nLife across the fences aims to empower youth workers and leaders of IVS organisations to deal with the topic of migration by increasing intercultural awareness and aims at improving active participation and commitment among youth.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we set the following objectives:\r\n- To promote mutual understanding and constructive debate among the participants by encouraging them to approach intercultural dialogue with tolerance and open-minded attitude;\r\n- To bring the participants to an active reflection on the topic through non-formal education activities and experiential learning;\r\n- To empower the participants - and through them other actors in their communities of origin - by strengthening their skills, in particular the ones needed to organize projects, raising awareness actions and events at local, national and international level; \r\n- To introduce Youthpass as a tool for self-assessment, evaluation and recognition of non-formal learning \r\nThe 30 participants and an organising and support team of 6 people will be from Hungary, Germany, France, Belgium, Poland, Greece, Spain, UK. The participants will be youth workers, leaders and volunteers of partner organisations of the IVS networks, who intend to widen their toolkit that better responds to the challenges of xenophobia among youth.  The activities will be a combination of exercises raising intercultural awareness and dialogue, learning about migration and human rights of migrants, political dimension of youth projects, raising awareness action and project development.\r\n\r\nWorking methods are designed according to the principles of experiential, non-formal learning in a multicultural context. The following working methods will be used during the activities of the TC: short interactive presentations by the trainers, presentations led by participants, facilitated discussions and brainstorming in plenary and in small groups, facilitated reflection groups to monitor and support the individual learning, activities in mixed nationality groups, couples, trios and individually followed by a debriefing, icebreakers, games and role play, artistic expression, artistic expression, video projection, interactive art gallery, opinion line, forum theatre, panel discussion, individual reflection, facilitated group reflection and evaluation.\r\n\r\nDeveloping an open-minded attitude to intercultural awareness and sensitivity will enable participants to respond to the growing xenophobic phenomena in their countries. Organising awareness raising actions contributes to active youth participation, developing future projects to increase intercultural dialogue will enhance international development co-operation between IVS organisation in the topic of migration. \r\nThe expected benefit is that partners can offer diverse activities under Raising Peace Campaign, which allows them to involve and engage young people on the long-term, as well as to reach new target groups. Young people develop a responsible attitude towards diversity. Moreover, the recognition of non-formal learning and international mobility as a tool of learning increases in the local communities.", "http://www.vap.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-HU01-KA105-036130_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["0PH", "VOLUNTEER ACTION FOR PEACE", 1156.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European youth area and the participation of young people in European democratic life (15.02.01.02)", "fts_2017_44653", 2017]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["8PT", "RJ1", "DULWICH COMMUNITY HOSPITAL"], ["8PT", "RJZ", "KING'S COLLEGE HOSPITAL (DULWICH)"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SE22"}
