The NEET (aged between 15 \u2013 29) are 2,5 millions (26,9%), is constantly growing from 19,5% in 2007, and even more alarming is that the 32% of them is going through this situation for over a year (OCSE data 20015).\r\n\r\nConsequently, the project aims to favour and promote:\r\n- Transition processes for young people into the labour market;\r\n- Reintegration processes of young people into education paths;\r\n- Continous staff training to favour \u201cchanging\u201d processes;\r\n- Intercultural approaches.\r\n\r\nThe 250 VET learners involved in the project are:\r\n- included in IVET training paths (2,3 e 4 annuality);\r\n- qualified young people, since no more than one year, in the following sectors: heating and plumbing, mechanic, electric, restaurant (cookery, bar), food processing (bakery), wellness (hairstyle and beauty), graphics and multimedia, administrative, tailoring and fashion.\r\n\r\nVET learners mobilities will have a length of 2,3 and 4 weeks in Spain, Ireland, UK, German, Austria and France.\r\nThe length of the mobiliy and the choise of the destination country will be closely linked to the tipology of Learning Outcomes identified in each youngster's mobility programme.\r\n\r\nThe realization of the mobilities will refer to  \u201cthe guide to transnational mobility services\u201d (http://www.scformazione.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/guida-servizi-GORES-sett2016-IT-5.pdf)\r\npubblished by SCF to facilitate and to promote awareness among the operators of the sending and the hosting organizations in terms of: \r\n- selection of the destination country on the base on the companies/sectors excellences to guarantee padagogical quality;\r\n- choise of the mobility lenght in line with the training project of the beneficiaries (training as: strengthening of the acquired competences, intercultural experience; training embedded with the formal path; work experience in addition to the learning path);\r\n- selection of the learning outcomes to be acquired during the mobility through valorization formulas (reuse of the knowledges and of the skills acquired abroad, transfer peer to peer) or utilization of \u201crecognition\u201d procedures through collecting, evaluation and validation tools foreseen by GORES. In particular it will be used in an experimental way  the web platform that SCF, presented to the DoYourMob event 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 50 VET Staff mobilities are addressed to different professional figures (Trainers, coordinators, tutor, educator) involved in training activities (both professionalised and cultural), tutoring, training on the job, orientation, supporting on the job, etc.\r\nThe main proposed topic is  the didactic innovation, observed from different perspectives and in particular:\r\n- work-based learning, digital teaching or in general learning through technologies; \r\n- internationalization of competences.\r\n\r\nFor these mobilities we distinguish between to 2 competence areas, in accordance with both Young People and Adult \u201cTarget\u201d\r\n- in the first one: IVET learners, including young people at despersion risk, with a physical and mental disadvantage, immigrants and unaccompanied migrant children;\r\n- in the second one: people over 18 (vulnerable persons in generale, e.g. unemployed, immigrants, people with disabilities), with a particular attention to NEET\r\n\r\nThe VET staff mobilities will last 3-5 days (included travel days)in Spain, France, UK, Finland, Austria and Ireland.\r\nThe project foresees, also, 10 training paths of 12 days in Uk and in Ireland for the English language training.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the VET staff mobility, SCF wants to invest on methodologies:\r\n* WBL in accordance with:\r\n- the coordination of its own network concerning the Dual System experimentation, in collaboration with CONFAP and FORMA (www.lanostraviaduale.it);\r\n- The promotion of the didactic enterprise in terms of pedagogical innovation.\r\n*Media Education in accordance with the investement started in 2013 with the Project
