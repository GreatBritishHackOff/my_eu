The LPC is mainly laboratory based with a spectrum of skills from molecular biology and bioinformatics through integrated research in animal models to human physiological research, including imaging.The German and Danish groups have large databases on neuropathic and postsurgical pain, respectively, while the Spanish centre offers expertise in human microneurography. We will undertake a series of six interlinked and mutually supportive programs of experimental research, underpinned and supported by a coordinated training and bioinformatics facility. These programs will form a series of workpackages each delivered through collaboration of network laboratories to bring together multiple techniques and considerable expertise to each area. In addition, there will be considerable synergies between the programs. The programs, which fully address the Call, will focus on: Neurobiological mechanisms of chronic pain; Improving animal models of pain; Translational pain models in humans; Mechanisms and assessment of pain in patients; Risk factors for chronic pain.", 9947.0, 18437779.0, "EUROPAIN", null, null, null, null, "http://www.nsc-tec.com", null, "fp7_203679_949699453"], ["3JQ", "Application for Broadband Availability Mapping (A-BAM)", "Point Topic Ltd", "The A-BAM (Application for Broadband Availability Mapping) project will develop a feasibility study for a mobile application that aggregates the needs of all the key stakeholders in the development of broadband connectivity, in one single place, throughout Europe: Local/Regional/National Administrations, End-Users and ISPs (Internet Service Providers). \n\nIt will assist users such as households or businesses to ascertain the broadband options and services that are available in any particular area, allowing where applicable to select other ISPs offering higher speed broadband services at their location through a Europe-wide switching service. This will benefit ISPs by providing an additional marketing channel to help them engage with, and attract, new customers. Additionally, it will enable households and SMEs to identify whether any government or privately funded broadband promotion schemes are already available and what these are, or identify any infrastructure schemes that are planned in the area. The application will aggregate and provide this data for local and regional governments in order to facilitate the tailoring as well as adoption of these schemes aimed at supporting Europe to meet the objectives set forth in the EC Digital Agenda: universal availability of Broadband speeds of at least 30 Mb/s throughout Europe, with 50% having speeds above 100 Mb/s.", 37262.0, 53232.0, "A-BAM", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_198564_953462180"], ["4AR", "Cultures of Disaster Resilience among children and young people", "The Save the Children Fund", "Cultural sensitivity is essential to effective disaster management and disaster risk reduction, yet disaster plans still largely ignore the needs and capacities of children and young people. Addressing Topic 2 of this call, the \u2018given cultural group\u2019 is therefore children, not viewed as a homogenous group, but one which offers diverse cultural perspectives and diverse experiences of roles taken on in disasters. By \u2018culture\u2019 we mean more than ethnicity, important though that is; we also refer to social class, vulnerability, age, gender, disability and migration status. Cultures of Recovery and Resilience among children and young people in Disasters (CUiDAR) will address the exclusion of children and young people from the disaster planning and management process; it will provide innovative and creative communication channels for children\u2019s voices to be heard and it will develop a child centred disasters management framework for use by policy/decision makers in participating countries, the EU and beyond. To achieve the objectives we have designed a suite of activities: scoping; dialogues with children (consultative workshops); regional level mutual learning exercises; national level awareness and communication events; framework design/building, and an in-depth ongoing approach to dissemination. Our unique partnership with the major children\u2019s charity Save the Children enables the Consortium to work closely with children to achieve our objectives. Our strong existing links with emergency planners and authorities enables us to access key audiences. Each workpackage is designed to create stronger awareness of needs and capacities of children and will enable enhanced local, national and EU institutional and policy response for what is a growing and urgent societal problem: how to develop meaningful and effective disaster management (including response, recovery and resilience).", 276949.0, 1662362.0, "CUIDAR", null, null, null, null, null,
