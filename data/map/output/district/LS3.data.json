For interns and skilled workers who work abroad processes and methods in safety are hard to understand because they differ from one European country to the other. In this Erasmus+ Mobility Project the focus will be on \u201cSafety at Work as compared to European Standards\u201d. \r\nObjectives:\r\nIn this project the different rules and regulations in the field of safety at work will be examined, documented and discussed. It is the aim to expand the school curriculum and the vocational curriculum through knowledge of European work safety processes and methods. \r\nProfile and Background of the Participants\r\nAll 111 participants stem from the German Dual Apprenticeship and already have basic knowledge in the field of safety at work. The comparison between German safety regulations and standards with the ones in the partner countries is the added value of this project. \r\nActivities and Methods\r\nBefore and during the project safety at work will be the core theme. Within the framework of their work placements, the participants will contrast, compare, document and realise German and Finnish safety rules together with students of their partner school in the companies and schools. \r\nExpected Results:\r\nThe following learning goals will be achieved:\r\na. The participants will carry out a work placement focussing on safety at work as compared to European standards and document, compare and evaluate it.\r\nb. The participants will inform themselves about safety standards in other European countries before they take up employment abroad.\r\nc. The participants gain the ability and competence to inform themselves about safety at work in a European country and to obey safety regulations at work.\r\nPotential long-term Benefits\r\nSafety at work is often reduced through the existence of an accident insurance. Your own safety regulations at work have to be completed through regulations of the other country. This creates trust in the companies which offer the work placements, in the German companies which provide apprenticeships and in the participants of the project. A better preparation for regulations of safety at work in partner countries guarantees a successful mobility project.", "http://www.leedscitycollege.ac.uk/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003636_6"], ["1AA", "European Vocational Competencies Through Work Based Learning III", "Leeds City College", 113247.0, "Participating parties in the 'European Vocational Competencies Through Work Based Learning' III-project (EVC III), are vocational colleges and enterprises in the region of D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, providing job training.

It also aims for improving the quality of the education and to become one of the top five educational institutes within MBO/VET by seeking strengthening the professionalism and working towards excellence in all levels and areas. Internationalisation will help provide the tool for all learners in ROCvA to be internationally and interculturally competent, help them acquire the new 21st century skills and be prepared and skilled for the global workfield.\r\nROCvA provides an added value to its vocational educational programmes by enhancing the quality and quantity of its international mobilities for learners and staff. It is necessary to achieve a better uderstanding of the educational systems within Europe and by cooperation with institutions and enterprises within Europe to share best practices that help to develop personal, generic and professional competences of teaching staff and learners; thus improve the quality of education, the learning - teaching process, internships and thus enhance employability for our learners and staff. International activities form an integral part of the Team Plans and thus integral part of the complex educational programme.\r\nErasmus+ KA1 is about mobilities so most of the planned activities are student and staff mobilities. Individual mobilities, internships, study programmes, language courses, job shadowing, study exchanges will have been offered and organised by ROCvA for all its students and teachers on a decentralised level by the Programme Teams in cooperation with the College International Cordinator of the ROCvA MBO Colleges.

The MCAST trains and prepares youths and adults in a wide range of specialised skills in order to provide the bulk of the manpower needed by the local industry on a national level. \r\nIt is therefore crucial in the current global scenario for the MCAST to keep its VET system constantly updated by exposing and training its students and staff in other countries and beyond the national VET scenario. In itself the project acts as an essential cross-fertilisation project for VET education across the EU. \r\nThe main activities associated with the participation in this project will include: \r\n1) In line with the MCAST Internationalisation Strategy (Annex 1), the participation of the MCAST in this Erasmus+ project will give learners a unique enhancement to their educational experiences as they will have the opportunity of going on traineeships in companies and vocational education institutions in other European countries.  This is especially important within the context of a globalised economy: the students are presented with the opportunity of training in the international employment market. This project would offer over 120 students the opportunity to do an international VET learner traineeship in a company or vocational college and giving them the chance to apply the knowledge they learnt at the College, to learn new practical skills from their placements but also to be able to learn about a different European country and its culture. On successful completion of the mobility, a Europass Mobility Certificate will be issued to each participant in recognition of the experience gained. \r\nFor each of its six different institutes, the MCAST has identified a number of potential partners which will host students in companies, organisations or colleges abroad. These partnerships and their links to the different institutes and areas of studies are summarised in the attached Annex 2.  The expected learning outcomes for the students going on an Erasmus+ traineeship are: \r\na. to get work experience in their specific sector\r\nb. to recognise the main challenges in the sector\r\nc. to perform tasks independently & in a team\r\nd. to use standard tools & accessories in the specific sector\r\ne. to appreciate the main differences between the local market & the European market\r\nf. to appreciate different people, languages & cultures\r\nThe MCAST will also send students from the  Centre for Maritime Studies (CMS) on VET mobilities which last 6 months. These students will conduct practical training on board ships. This is fundamental for the students to acquire their profession as maritime officer. The Erasmus+ program will also offer OLS support to these students who often have to work on vessels to improve on their language skills.\r\nOne of the major changes in the scope of the mobility flows is the substantial increase in mobilities of learners and staff in the Netherlands. For 2017 and 2018 the MCAST, in line with its European Internationalization Strategy, desires to increase the number of VET learner traineeships in vocational institutes in colleges based in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands. In 2018 both Valletta and Leeuwarden will be cultural capitals of Europe. The MCAST has initiated several collaborative projects with the colleges of ROC Friese Poort , Nordwin  and Friesland for 2018. The MCAST desires to send 40 learners to carry out a traineeship in these vocational colleges in the Netherlands to work on collaborative projects. These collaborative projects will not only give an exposure to students in their area of study but will foster a cultural exchange between two European countries.  Students from all of the MCAST institutes, including: creative arts, sciences, engineering, business, ICT and community services will be eligible to apply. These Dutch colleges have strong ties with local industries and can give a good exposure to MCAST Technical College students in the respective industries.\r\n2)  Staff; For MCAST staff to stay updated and relevant in today's educational system it is crucial that the staff is regularly trained and kept abreast with technological advancement. Through this project the staff would be given an opportunity to receive a 5-day training in other vocational schools besides the opportunity to observe new areas of study, new technologies, new teaching methods etc. This will be a cross-fertilisation exercise across VET institutions. The mobilities will be in line with the MCAST training needs (Annex 3).\r\n3) Students and staff with special needs will have an equal opportunity to apply and participate in this project. These participants will be supported whole-heartedly by the MCAST International Office and the NA, including the provision of accompanying persons where needed. \r\nFinally, refer to Annex 4 for the Application, Selection Procedure and Dissemination.", "http://www.leedscitycollege.ac.uk/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-MT01-KA116-026912_6"], ["1AA", "International Work Experience for Staff and Students", "Leeds City College", 130193.0, "The overall objective for the colleges in our consortium is through this project to strenghten the international perspective in our educations in order to appear as attractive educational centres to students and staff  and as competent collaborators for international cooperation within the  scope of the colleges. This project encompasses 92 social and health care students and child care students plus 14 teachers. This is a minor reduction in the number of students probably due to the three-party agreement which meant a reduction in the number of Pedagogical Assistant students. The main objectives of the project with regard to the students are to provide a basis for the students to obtain knowledge about international relations especially within the social and health care area and the child care area. Furthermore to strengthen the students' intercultural competences through practice placements abroad by strengthing their skills in foreign languages and their personal and professional competences hereby  improving their employablity at both the Danish and the European labour market. With regard to the staff the main objectives are to strengthen the development of quality and innovation mainly in teaching at our colleges and to enhance internationalisation sending out members of our staff for supplementary education abroad.  in February SOSU-Fyn, SOSU-Esbjerg and da Vinci College in Dordrecht will meet to discuss the possiblities of exchanging teachers on a more structural basis with focus on pedagogics in relation to rehabilitation and psychiatry. \r\nFor students the stays last 1 month,  for teachers typically 1 week. The stays will be arranged in cooperation with our partners abroad, mostly vocational colleges that offer similar educations. These partners many of which we have cooperated fruitfully with for several years have committed themselves by Memorandum of Understanding / Letter of Intent to fulfil the demands of the project. \r\nThe fields of responsiblity are laid down in MoU / LoI and are briefly mentioned as follows: Sending college undertakes the responsiblity to prepare the participants, draw up the necessary documents according to  the Erasmus+ Programme, make sure the participants have the insurrances and health care insurrance required by the Erasmus+ Programme, transfer the grant from the Erasmus+ programme and inform the participants about  possible means of transport to the destination. The receiving organisation undertakes to find a suitable practice placement, make sure that there is a mantor at the practice placement, provide a suitable accommodation, be avaliable for the participants to contact in case they need support that cannot be carried out by the practice placement, and make sure that an evaluation takes place at the end of the stay.\r\nIn the comments to the Charter for our Consortium it was stated that some points are missing: 1) more definite plans for our activities in the international strategies of our colleges 2) the frame and intentions for our work with receiving students and teachers from abroad for practice placements and staff traning  3) considerations about future demands for adding new partneres to our project. With regard to item 1 it is a topic that we have planned to address on our meetings in the consortium where we would discuss how we in cooperation with our managers and principals will develop our international strategies in line with the European and Danish political objectives.

The intention is also to give our students and members of staff a possiblity to exchange experiences about relevant topics an hereby enhance  the interest for and understanding of international activities in VET. Concerning item 3 it is a topic that we currently discuss. At our last meeting  in December 2016 we decided to try to esatblish new partnerships with  two colleges, one in Sweden and one in the Netherlands. At a contact seminar arranged by Arbeit und Leben in Hamburg in December 2016 we met representatives from what seems to be reliable colleges, that showed  interest in working together with us and that will be able to live up to our requirements for exchange of students and staff.

It includes a module \"Personal Trainer\", which will be carried out together with our partner Future Focus in Malta. 14 students will carry out three moths training and workplacement period in Malta and one teacher and one tutor from working life will join the training for two weeks.\r\n\r\nThe partner group is old, reliable and includes partners for all of the study fields of college KSAO. It co-operates also in the frames of KA2-projects of their own study fields and developes further contents of the study programs, workplacements periods and experts' exchanges. With these projects the partner group intoroduces new partners, who will support the co-operation and also international co-operation of college KSAO.\r\n\r\nInternational activities of Kouvola Region Vocational College are managed and developed in the frames of the Strategy of the City of Kouvola, Kouvola Region Vocational College and its International Activities. The International Program of the college is for 2015-2020 and  will be updated every year. The main  objectives of the strategy are to develop flexible learning pathways, mentoring  and wide and flexible ways for achieving learning outcomes. During the mobility periods these objectives will be developed together with foreign partners.  During the mobility periods students and experts will develop their vocational and language skills, skills to work in a multicultural working environment and develop their life long learning skills.\r\n\r\nKouvola Region Vocational College informs about its international activities on the web sites of the college and by using social media like Facebook. All of the participants write a blog during their moblity periods, these are published on the websites of college  KSAO (www.ksao.fi). The college informs about its international activities and projects in publications of the college, the City of Kouvola, local newspaper, local radio and events organized byt the college.", "http://www.leedscitycollege.ac.uk/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA116-034473_11"], ["1AA", "Planes, Trains & Mobilities to VET Opportunities across Europe", "Leeds City College", 490749.0, "Leeds City College aims to maximise every opportunity to help our students to obtain the critical, in-demand skills and competences sought after by employers and to ensure that all students are prepared for future progression to further/higher education, Apprenticeships & /or sustained employment. \r\nPlanes, Trains and Mobilities to Vet Opportunities across Europe, along with localised work experience and enrichment activities, will drive this intention. Beneficiaries will be able to engage in the working practices, cultures and society of their European counterparts which in turn will determine their attitudes and the values that they place in Europe and International engagement. \r\nAs well as the intrinsic development of employability and the technical /educational enhancement of sector specific skills and professional craft, the Mobility placements provide a unique experience for all beneficiaries, but especially students, to develop greater resilience as they encounter new situations, ways of working and living which challenge and extend their own knowledge, experience and aspirations. Given the increasing pace of global change, including the unknown impact of \u2018brexit\u2019, independent learning, employability and transitional skills are imperative for our students to sharpen their competitive edge and to cope and thrive with the ever-changing pressures of employment, re skilling, up skilling and responding to diversification of employment work patterns.\r\nQualitative evidence demonstrates that successful completion of an overseas placement has an impact on student beneficiaries\u2019 personal development & maturity but also gives them a level of credibility and differentiation that can contribute significantly to their future progression. Access to mobility placements is hugely advantageous to LCC students, many of whom have underachieved at school and lack the basic, vocational and soft skills required to access jobs. \r\n\r\nPlanes, Trains & Mobilities will enable 203 LCC students from 14 curriculum schools to participate in a variety of work settings in 15 countries, hosted by 27 partners.\r\n25 Staff will participate in Staff Trainer Activities (STA) and 50 staff will participate as accompanying tutors to student placement.\r\n\r\nThe key themes running through the 17-19 project are: \r\n*The continued enhancement of sector specific, employability and other transferable skills with reference to Europe 2020 and the Leeds City Region LEP Strategic Economic Plan 2016-36 \r\n*The continue to implement ECVET to add value and enhance independent learning\r\n*To underpin college expertise through teaching methodology, strategic awareness and exposure to different EU approaches and to apply good practice to inform curriculum design, college wide services and professional acumen to the benefit of the wider college and college group\r\n*To scope partner response and solutions to changing employment markets, in particular how mismatches of supply and demand are met.\r\n*To ensure that dissemination activities have a wider impact & that a ripple effect can be achieved for the benefit of the wider college and external networks - ref European Internationalisation Development Plan (EIDP)\r\n*To work with partners to develop post \u2018brexit\u2019 strategies to ensure that that this hugely important reciprocal co-operation can be sustained and grown, with reference to the EIDP and 2017/18 Internationalisation Strategy.\r\n\r\nThe project will include opportunities for students with learning difficulties and other disabilities building on the partnerships established in 2016-18 and aims to continue to grow the number of apprentice beneficiaries, as outlined in the EIDP for 2017/18. For the SLDD placements, accompanying tutors will provide a high level of support for the full duration of the mobility.\r\nThe STA allocation includes greater involvement from senior management, apprenticeship specialists and student services. \r\nThe majority of partners are well established and through the quality review process offer sector specific placements that fully adhere to students qualifications and sector ambitions. These relationships have also led to the STA placements that aim to improve good practice and to share /refocus strategic approach and bias. In line with the EIDP, new partners have been introduced  to further the scope of beneficiary experience and the wider impact on the operational awareness of  LCC, with reference to niche work placement opportunities, curriculum quality and shared experience of multi campus, city based colleges and large economically and ethnically diverse student cohorts. \r\n\r\nThe range of partners and member states enables LCC to oversee a wide range of employer and education practice, cultural & social priorities and different methodology & bias. The quality of partnerships ensures that placements are a good fit, that it is realistic to implement ECVET across the majority of student mobilities and that the safety and safeguarding of beneficiaries is secured.", "http://www.leedscitycollege.ac.uk/", "Leeds City College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA116-036084_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1AA", "Reach Higher", "West Yorkshire Colleges Consortium", "The project, \u2018Reach Higher\u2019 will widen participation in higher level skills through a programme of activities co-designed by employers that will attract and engage new participants onto higher level courses, allow progression onto courses which will lead to a qualification and ultimately into employment in the key sectors filling gaps and shortages in the city region.", "ESF", 3500000.0, 7000000.0, "esf_england_673"], ["1AA", "More Skills Better Jobs", "West Yorkshire Colleges Consortium", "The project, \u201cMore Skills, Better Jobs\u201d will provide individuals in low-paid employment with access to training and improved skill levels, leading to greater earning potential.
