Current pharmacological therapies for PD carry side-effects and become less effective as the disease progresses.  This causes immense suffering for patients in their daily lives. There is currently no established disease-modifying, regenerative or neuroprotective treatment for PD. Such a therapy would revolutionize the capacity to effectively treat PD patients and could dramatically reduce the multi-billion \u20ac annual cost to Europe. The project will conduct a multi-centre clinical trial in PD using intracerebroventricular administration of PDGF-BB. To obtain the most relevant information from the clinical trial, state-of-the-art disease rating scales and brain imaging technology will be used to monitor changes related to restoration of brain function. Planning and conduct of the clinical study will involve investigators and advisors with extensive expertise in the disease-area and experience with participating in clinical studies. To further advance the understanding of the regenerative mechanism, preclinical studies will be performed. We will set up a framework of partners to ensure proper governance of the clinical study, compliant with fundamental ethical principles of European regulations concerning studies on \u201cadvanced therapies medicinal products\u201d.

These difficulties are passed on to those producing and reading systematic reviews, many of whom have experienced the frustration of finding that the original researchers either did not measure certain outcomes or measured them in such different ways that it is difficult or impossible to compare, contrast or combine the studies.\n\nA core outcome set is a set of outcomes which should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all clinical trials for a specific condition. Core outcome sets (COS) could have implications across all areas of health research, reduce heterogeneity between trials and lead to research that is more likely to have measured relevant outcomes. COS would enhance the value of evidence synthesis by reducing the risk of outcome reporting bias and ensuring that all trials contribute usable information.\n\nThe COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) Initiative aims to develop an international network of individuals and organisations interested in the development, application and promotion of core outcome sets.

In current clinical practice, patients with chronic CAD are followed using non-invasive imaging methodologies for possible adverse morphologic remodelling and functional recovery of the myocardium before the decision for invasive examinations and treatments is taken.  Technological developments have brought about several newer imaging methodologies (and associated parameters) that have shown accurate prognostic results under study conditions in selected patient populations. Each of these methodologies offers intrinsic advantages and disadvantages due to the physiologic processes it tries to assess, due to the technology it requires or due to its availability (often determined by its associated cost). However, to date, no large scale studies have made a direct comparison of the different methodologies towards predicting adverse morphologic remodelling or functional recovery of the myocardium after medical therapy. The lack of such information results in a sub-optimal use of the methodologies at hand.  The aim of DOPPLER-CIP is therefore to conduct a multi-centre clinical study including about 1200 patients in order to determine the optimal prognostic parameters derived from (new) non-invasive imaging for a patient presenting with suspected chronic ischemic heart disease.

A major reason for the high morbidity and mortality is that the heart has an inadequate regenerative response to the myocardial necrosis sustained following AMI; cell death from the ischaemic damage can lead to progressive ventricular dilation and dysfunction through the processes of vascular remodelling. Despite the use of full conventional treatment, including ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, aldosterone inhibitors and diuretics, yearly mortality rates of patients with post-infarction heart failure are still in the range of 13 % and rehospitalisation for worsening of heart failure occurs at a yearly rate of 6\u20138%.\n\nClinical data now exists supporting the concept that autologous bone marrow derived cells can restore cardiac function following AMI.

So far partners have compared different methods for bone marrow processing to deliver the desired mononuclear cell fraction. The optimal method for BM-MNC preparation has been further standardised so that it could be delivered in hospitals across the EU.\n\nIn addition, scientists have selected the best route for BM-MNC delivery. In the context of AMI, intracoronary infusion is usually employed to administer the cells since it is supported by evidence and safety data. The technique entails balloon angioplasty and cell infusion through an over-the-wire (OTW) balloon. The clinical trial will take place in eight participating countries with an additional 12 active satellite sites across Europe, which have recruited a total of 84 patients so far.\n\nTaken together, the BAMI study will provide solid evidence on the efficacy of BM-MNC therapy in patients undergoing primary angioplasty.
