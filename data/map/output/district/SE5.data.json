Current pharmacological therapies for PD carry side-effects and become less effective as the disease progresses.  This causes immense suffering for patients in their daily lives. There is currently no established disease-modifying, regenerative or neuroprotective treatment for PD. Such a therapy would revolutionize the capacity to effectively treat PD patients and could dramatically reduce the multi-billion \u20ac annual cost to Europe. The project will conduct a multi-centre clinical trial in PD using intracerebroventricular administration of PDGF-BB. To obtain the most relevant information from the clinical trial, state-of-the-art disease rating scales and brain imaging technology will be used to monitor changes related to restoration of brain function. Planning and conduct of the clinical study will involve investigators and advisors with extensive expertise in the disease-area and experience with participating in clinical studies. To further advance the understanding of the regenerative mechanism, preclinical studies will be performed. We will set up a framework of partners to ensure proper governance of the clinical study, compliant with fundamental ethical principles of European regulations concerning studies on \u201cadvanced therapies medicinal products\u201d.

These difficulties are passed on to those producing and reading systematic reviews, many of whom have experienced the frustration of finding that the original researchers either did not measure certain outcomes or measured them in such different ways that it is difficult or impossible to compare, contrast or combine the studies.\n\nA core outcome set is a set of outcomes which should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all clinical trials for a specific condition. Core outcome sets (COS) could have implications across all areas of health research, reduce heterogeneity between trials and lead to research that is more likely to have measured relevant outcomes. COS would enhance the value of evidence synthesis by reducing the risk of outcome reporting bias and ensuring that all trials contribute usable information.\n\nThe COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) Initiative aims to develop an international network of individuals and organisations interested in the development, application and promotion of core outcome sets.

In current clinical practice, patients with chronic CAD are followed using non-invasive imaging methodologies for possible adverse morphologic remodelling and functional recovery of the myocardium before the decision for invasive examinations and treatments is taken.  Technological developments have brought about several newer imaging methodologies (and associated parameters) that have shown accurate prognostic results under study conditions in selected patient populations. Each of these methodologies offers intrinsic advantages and disadvantages due to the physiologic processes it tries to assess, due to the technology it requires or due to its availability (often determined by its associated cost). However, to date, no large scale studies have made a direct comparison of the different methodologies towards predicting adverse morphologic remodelling or functional recovery of the myocardium after medical therapy. The lack of such information results in a sub-optimal use of the methodologies at hand.  The aim of DOPPLER-CIP is therefore to conduct a multi-centre clinical study including about 1200 patients in order to determine the optimal prognostic parameters derived from (new) non-invasive imaging for a patient presenting with suspected chronic ischemic heart disease. The modality used to extract these parameters is of secondary importance. However, as both the accuracy and the cost related to extracting a particular parameter is modality-dependent, DOPPLER-CIP will also make a cost-effectiveness analysis in order to determine which modality should preferentially be used to extract the clinically most relevant parameter.", 181309.0, 2887966.0, "DOPPLER-CIP", "Remodelling in coronary artery disease", "Comparison of the imaging modalities available for the prediction of remodelling in coronary artery disease (CAD) should help physicians make a more informed diagnostic decision.", "CAD remains the primary cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in Europe. CAD is defined by arterial narrowing leading to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen consumption and supply (ischaemia) and ultimately coronary occlusion, resulting in myocardial infarction. This induces adverse changes in heart morphology and functional deterioration.\n\nTreatment entails specific medication and often the restoration of blood flow through techniques like balloon angioplasty or a venous or arterial vessel graft to surgically bypass the stenosis. Given the associated risks of such invasive examinations and treatments, it is necessary to predict the morphologic remodelling and functional recovery of the myocardium.\n\nA number of non-invasive imaging methodologies have been developed that could be used to predict remodelling.

A major reason for the high morbidity and mortality is that the heart has an inadequate regenerative response to the myocardial necrosis sustained following AMI; cell death from the ischaemic damage can lead to progressive ventricular dilation and dysfunction through the processes of vascular remodelling. Despite the use of full conventional treatment, including ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, aldosterone inhibitors and diuretics, yearly mortality rates of patients with post-infarction heart failure are still in the range of 13 % and rehospitalisation for worsening of heart failure occurs at a yearly rate of 6\u20138%.\n\nClinical data now exists supporting the concept that autologous bone marrow derived cells can restore cardiac function following AMI.

Although long term prognosis has improved with the introduction of reperfusion therapies, in certain cases mortality can be high.\n\nOver the past decade a number of studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of administering autologous bone marrow derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) after an AMI. The EU-funded http://www.bami-fp7.eu/ (BAMI) (The effect of intracoronary reinfusion of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) on all-cause mortality in acute myocardial infarction) project wants to establish whether BM-MNC therapy is more beneficial than standard reperfusion therapy.\n\nThe consortium is conducting a Phase III multi-national, randomised and controlled study to demonstrate that an intracoronary infusion of autologous BM-MNC is superior compared to optimal reperfusion therapy alone. So far partners have compared different methods for bone marrow processing to deliver the desired mononuclear cell fraction. The optimal method for BM-MNC preparation has been further standardised so that it could be delivered in hospitals across the EU.\n\nIn addition, scientists have selected the best route for BM-MNC delivery. In the context of AMI, intracoronary infusion is usually employed to administer the cells since it is supported by evidence and safety data. The technique entails balloon angioplasty and cell infusion through an over-the-wire (OTW) balloon. The clinical trial will take place in eight participating countries with an additional 12 active satellite sites across Europe, which have recruited a total of 84 patients so far.\n\nTaken together, the BAMI study will provide solid evidence on the efficacy of BM-MNC therapy in patients undergoing primary angioplasty. Considering the economic losses incurred from patient sick leave or incapacity to work due to chronic disease, an improved therapeutic intervention should reduce hospitalisation and mortality rates.
