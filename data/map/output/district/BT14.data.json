The project is a continuation of an approved project in 2015, aiming to meet the training needs presented by local youths. The main objective is to promote student mobility in VET intermediate level of the following professional sectors: Vehicles electromechanics and Telecommunications facilities (IES San Jose), Administrative Management (IES Carmen Laffon), Aesthetic (IES Miguel de Ma\u00f1ara) and Welding and Boilers (IES Antonio Ulloa), to complete their training in a professional environment and increase their chances of integration in the labor market. \r\nThe internships will contemplate two modalities:\r\n- Practices for second year students who perform their FCT compulsory internship abroad, concluding the program with the acquisition of their title.\r\n- Practices for young graduates, who will make their experience as an extracurricular training\r\n\r\n25 participants will be involved, aged between 18 and 25 years without previous work experience (in the majority of the cases),  and selected through a public and common process between centers.\r\nThe training periods last 8 or 12 weeks, doing internships in companies in Italy, United Kingdom and Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe results and expected impact of participants will be clear: \r\nTo complement their academic education with an internship \r\nTo have their first work experience\r\nTo increase their language skills\r\nTo acquire a profile of versatile skills\r\nTo learn to use new technologies and work tools\r\nTo develop their transversal skills (autonomy, maturity, observation, reflection and adaptation)\r\nTo get a formal recognition of competences acquired through the Europass mobility document \r\nTo get to know new cultures and social habits\r\nTo promote their interest in lifelong learning \r\nTo increase their chances of recruitment once they have completed traineeship\r\n\r\nRegarding the members of the consortium, the results are: \r\nTo offer young people of La Rinconada (Spain) attractive possibilities to complete their training\r\nTo develop programs that encourage new recruitment opportunities\r\nTo reduce the unemployment rate in the municipality\r\nTo enhance local, regional, national and international economic development\r\nTo create a local network working\r\nTo create an international network\r\nTo acquire new working methods and technologies used in companies.\r\nThe project maintains a line of work initiated in the previous edition of the project, and the prospect is to make it sustainable over time. Once the consortium is created and work in concert, and once the project is known among the student population increasing its demand, the expected aim is to be able to increase the number of mobilities each year and involve other target group, like the staff schools. \r\n\r\nAlso it\u2019s expected to strengthen the network and cooperation, both locally and internationally, to exchange new ideas and new projects.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-035642_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT14"}
