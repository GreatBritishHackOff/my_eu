By integrating these new, innovative process steps with full automation in -nowadays mostly manually performed- complex handling operations, it will be possible to obtain a fully automated and highly adaptable manufacturing chain. 3D-LightTrans will open the way to a totally new concept for the design, manufacturing and application of composites for low-cost mass products in a wide range of sectors.\nThe Consortium brings together multidisciplinary research teams involving five industrial stakeholders from machine tools and machine automation (P-D Glasseiden, Van de Wiele, Lindauer Dornier, Coatema) and several OEM active in the field of processing of flexible materials and composite manufacturing, including Federal Mogul, among others, as well as from the application sector (FIAT and Bentley), and extensive expertise from well known research specialists in the area of materials, production research and technical textiles in particular, like AIT, TU-Dresden and University of Ghent.", 99217.0, 6482506.0, "3D-LIGHTTRANS", "Fibrous fabrics reinforce plastics", "Textile-reinforced polymer composites (TRPCs) could provide even more benefits than simpler fibre-reinforced ones. Comprehensive and cost-effective technology covering the entire production chain could expand markets from niche to mass production.", "Advanced polymer composites such as reinforced plastics combine the light weight and low cost of a polymer matrix with the superior properties of the reinforcing fibres embedded in it. When these fibres are woven to create fabrics, even more benefits can be expected. However, widespread commercial application has so far been hindered, largely due to processing difficulties and their inherently high costs.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Large scale manufacturing technology for high-performance lightweight 3D multifunctional composites' (http://www.3d-lighttrans.com/ (3D-LIGHTTRANS)) project is overcoming these limitations. A highly flexible manufacturing chain for low-cost production of high-performance 3D TRPCs will open new markets beyond aeronautics. Targets include transportation, health, energy, leisure and other important sectors.\n\nConsortium members are exploiting individual processes developed by partners. Multi-material semi-finished fabrics made of hybrid yarn are formed into draped, pre-fixed multi-layered and multifunctional 3D textile preforms. Thermoforming then creates the final composite part from those. Integration of the steps into a complete and automated process chain will pave the way to an entirely new concept for low-cost, mass production of TRPCs and applications.\n\nTwo demonstration parts, a wheel well and a tailgate, are being produced for the automotive industry from polyethylene terephthalate and glass fibre reinforcement. Extensive modelling of the 3D-LIGHTTRANS composites is supporting the work.\n\nProduction of hybrid yarns by the air mingling process is progressing. A multi-layer fabric has been developed according to demonstrator requirements and 120\u00a0m of it was produced on a newly modified partner loom for manufacturing of the demonstrators. The team is investigating sewing and bonding to increase width greater than that accommodated by the loom. This will provide important insight into such capabilities.\n\nRobotics capabilities for handling the fabrics are in place for scale-up of mass production. Manufacture of the demonstrators is underway and first data have been obtained on scale-up. A single piece takes approximately 35 minutes to produce.\n\nUsing lightweight materials will result in significant savings in fuel consumption, translating to both financial benefits for the consumer and reduced carbon dioxide emissions. Fully automated production will reduce production time and costs, resulting in more competitive EU manufacturers.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2015/156408.jpg", "fp7_98253_983032436"], ["6GL", "New siRNA Nanotherapy for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, targeting Janus kinase 3", "Alan Boyd Consultants Limited", "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are the second most common immune-mediated disorders in Europe, affecting more particularly young people. The current therapies, including antibodies, show three main drawbacks: efficacy, tolerability and convenience. NEW DEAL solution will offer radical therapeutic progress for all IBD patients, thanks to the improved efficacy and increased safety of the specific JAK3 inhibition, which has been proven in clinics to be a target of great interest, the better tolerability of siRNA in term of immunogenicity and the good convenience with oral administration. To achieve this challenge, we will address three objectives: i) Specifically inhibit JAK 3 in a highly selective and safer manner by the mean of siRNA carefully designed and validated, ii) Deliver the siRNA therapeutic locally to the inflamed gut, by combining innovative nanostructured lipid carriers enabling their transport across the mucus, the intestinal barrier and the plasma membrane of the target cells, with polymeric capsules for protecting siRNA nanotherapeutics during their transit along the GI tract, thus allowing an oral administration, and iii) Promote the clinical translation and the future industrial transfer of this new clinical product, by addressing manufacturing, safety and efficacy evaluation at the late preclinical stage, to generate a Regulatory Submission Package and a Clinical Development Plan. The NEW DEAL project brings together clinical experts on IBD, leading scientists in nanomedicine, RNAi biology and immunology, innovative SMEs with a strong background in nanosafety, design of capsules and regulatory issues and an established pharma company with historic expertise on gastroenterology medicinal products. If successful, NEW DEAL will open new avenues for siRNA-based therapy in IBD with oral administration.", 164650.0, 5233180.0, "NEW DEAL", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_206567_929306755"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CW1"}
