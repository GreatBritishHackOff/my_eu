By integrating these new, innovative process steps with full automation in -nowadays mostly manually performed- complex handling operations, it will be possible to obtain a fully automated and highly adaptable manufacturing chain. 3D-LightTrans will open the way to a totally new concept for the design, manufacturing and application of composites for low-cost mass products in a wide range of sectors.\nThe Consortium brings together multidisciplinary research teams involving five industrial stakeholders from machine tools and machine automation (P-D Glasseiden, Van de Wiele, Lindauer Dornier, Coatema) and several OEM active in the field of processing of flexible materials and composite manufacturing, including Federal Mogul, among others, as well as from the application sector (FIAT and Bentley), and extensive expertise from well known research specialists in the area of materials, production research and technical textiles in particular, like AIT, TU-Dresden and University of Ghent.", 99217.0, 6482506.0, "3D-LIGHTTRANS", "Fibrous fabrics reinforce plastics", "Textile-reinforced polymer composites (TRPCs) could provide even more benefits than simpler fibre-reinforced ones. Comprehensive and cost-effective technology covering the entire production chain could expand markets from niche to mass production.", "Advanced polymer composites such as reinforced plastics combine the light weight and low cost of a polymer matrix with the superior properties of the reinforcing fibres embedded in it. When these fibres are woven to create fabrics, even more benefits can be expected. However, widespread commercial application has so far been hindered, largely due to processing difficulties and their inherently high costs.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Large scale manufacturing technology for high-performance lightweight 3D multifunctional composites' (http://www.3d-lighttrans.com/ (3D-LIGHTTRANS)) project is overcoming these limitations. A highly flexible manufacturing chain for low-cost production of high-performance 3D TRPCs will open new markets beyond aeronautics. Targets include transportation, health, energy, leisure and other important sectors.\n\nConsortium members are exploiting individual processes developed by partners. Multi-material semi-finished fabrics made of hybrid yarn are formed into draped, pre-fixed multi-layered and multifunctional 3D textile preforms. Thermoforming then creates the final composite part from those. Integration of the steps into a complete and automated process chain will pave the way to an entirely new concept for low-cost, mass production of TRPCs and applications.\n\nTwo demonstration parts, a wheel well and a tailgate, are being produced for the automotive industry from polyethylene terephthalate and glass fibre reinforcement. Extensive modelling of the 3D-LIGHTTRANS composites is supporting the work.\n\nProduction of hybrid yarns by the air mingling process is progressing. A multi-layer fabric has been developed according to demonstrator requirements and 120\u00a0m of it was produced on a newly modified partner loom for manufacturing of the demonstrators. The team is investigating sewing and bonding to increase width greater than that accommodated by the loom. This will provide important insight into such capabilities.\n\nRobotics capabilities for handling the fabrics are in place for scale-up of mass production. Manufacture of the demonstrators is underway and first data have been obtained on scale-up. A single piece takes approximately 35 minutes to produce.\n\nUsing lightweight materials will result in significant savings in fuel consumption, translating to both financial benefits for the consumer and reduced carbon dioxide emissions.

The BBS Fredenberg is predominantly technically orientated and profits from a good co-operation  with  five large local companies in Salzgitter (VW, Salzgitter Steel Incorporation, MAN, Bosch and Alstom). In addition to that, the BBS Fredenberg, with a total of 2,300 students, offers technical training courses and a wide range of other instruction courses, including the areas of geriatric care, food and crafts and personal care.\r\nIn 1994 the first school partnership was established with the Industrial College in Staryj Oskol (Russia). In 1995 we established a partnership with a vocational school in Krakow and afterwards we formed partnerships with Swindon (GB) and Lappeenranta ( Suomi ).\r\nSince 2014 we have a successful co-operation  with both Tandem and the Foundation for German-Russian Youth Exchange. The school\u00b4s EU group, which is responsible for the coordination of European activities as well as exchange programmes, consists of eight members and meetings are held monthly. \r\nIn 2015 the latest Erasmus+ programme started, which includes a co-operation between VW as our school\u00b4s partner and Bentley in Crewe, England. In 2016 four apprentices from VW spent three weeks in the Bentley plant to get a hands-on experience into new areas of the production as well as the maintenance area. Further exchanges are planned from both sides.\r\n\r\nLooking as the aspects listed above it can be seen that the main aim of the Erasmus + project is the improvement of long life learning, so that the participants can increase their competences in the fields of creativity, flexibility and problem solving strategies, which will eventually lead to an increase in social and individual skills from the participants\u00b4 side.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this independent and multi perspective debate helps the participants of the programmes to actively adapt to their current working situations and conditions, so that the experience they gained abroad can be actively used to transfer their gained knowledge in their daily future working life. \r\n\r\nFurthermore another important aim of this project is an improvement of the participants\u00b4 foreign-language competence. \r\nA common goal of all involved partners is the adjustment of the vocational training in the European Qualifications Framework to provide comparable qualifications and thus to make an acceptance of foreign school leaving certificates easier in order to create more clearance for an occupational mobility.\r\n\r\nWe work with \"old\u201c as well as \"new\" project partners. With the \"old\u201c project partners (Poland and Finland) we share a long tradition of both successful teacher and student exchange programmes. Our newest partners are a Spanish Kindergarden, the Bentley plant in England and a vocational school in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe possible participants of the programme are around 30 students of the BBS Fredenberg, who are either involved in dual apprenticeships (i. e. as geriatric nurses, as bakers or bakery shop assistants, industrial mechanics, electronics engineers for automation technology and mechatronics), the others are in schooling to become nursery nurses or social assistants.\r\n\r\nThe selection criteria for the participants are based on the following aspects: \r\nlegal age, interests and motivation, academic achievements, foreign language skills, reliability and an open and mature personality as well as the ability to work under pressure. \r\n\r\nIn addition to their regular schooling or apprenticeships the students will be prepared concerning  linguistic and cultural aspects of the host country. During their stay in the host country the partner institution will welcome the students, supervise them and evaluate their learning and working effort afterwards. In addition to that our partners committed to our students getting to know cultural specifics of their host country.\r\n\r\nWe expect our participants to achieve the planned goals locally as well as regionally and also want them to share and spread their experiences and knowledge in school among their classmates, at work or just by talking about it.  \r\n\r\nMoreover we hope that the current project will give us the opportunity to develop new and innovative projects.
