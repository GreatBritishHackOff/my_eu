CP2 utilises multi-modal sensing to identify both Cardiac Performance as well as Vascular system performance from the subject, in 30 seconds, with the subject remaining clothed. The CP2 system draws on the experience from monitoring high performance engines within the world of F1 motorsport and transfers these techniques into medical care. By using new diagnostic sensing technologies and by analyzing the data for Biomarkers, the project is be able to identify the following disorders of the Cardio-Vascular system. Hypertension, Peripheral Arterial Disease, Aortic Stenosis, Atrial Fibrillation, Atrial Flutter, Ectopic beats, Bradycardia, Tachycardia and Type 1 & 2 Heart Block. The CP2 system works by placing an array of sensors under both wrists, with the subject actively engaged in the process. No straps or restraints are involved, the subject remains in complete control at all times throughout the process and so there is the potential to reduce 'Hypertensive White Coat' syndrome. The new multimodal sensing system allows both the Vascular and Cardio side of the Heart and Circulatory system to be tested simultaneously and the results from both halves to the equation to be reviewed against each other. The CP2 project thus brings together existing physiological parameters in new forms that should not only allow the identification of known disease, but also might lead to the establishment of biomarkers previously undetected owing to the two systems being operated asynchronously. It is easy to produce a better incarnation of what has gone before, but CP2 seeks to produce a paradigm shift in the usage of medical devices in the proactive screening role. With a screening taking only 30 seconds the opportunity exists to optimise the patient care pathway and to enhance patient flow within Primary Care locations.'", 38542.0, 55061.0, "CP2", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_194656_938095537"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9LS", "MINT Exchange", "CARNFORTH HIGH", 246040.0, "Modern science - especially natural science are a very interesting and important topic for the future of Europe. For the employees of the future, for pupils and for teachers, influencer and trainer this subject and the social skills will be also most important. But we see that science mainly is teached to young people in schools using the methods of formal education. On the other hand pupils, trainers, influencers and teachers come to outdoor centres and looking for active-oriented methods. Companies are looking for workers with social skills and knowledge in natural science. Young people want to increase their knowledge of the culture of other European nations and want to travel and see pupils from other states. Because of this we will make a exchange program by using intercultural, outdoor, environmental and experience education and active-oriented methods. The innovative idea is that not only whole school classes will take part in this project, but 5-6 pupils from different schools from Germany, the U.K., Croatia (as a new member of the EU) and France. Germany and France are used in partnership activities for many years, the partnership with Croatia and the U.K. are new. First there is a teach the teacher program so that teachers from different schools and nations come together, learning active-oriented methods, use a common language (english) and get knowing a lot of the different cultures and of new teaching methods. They also get knowledge to improve their own competences. The second step are the student exchanges - two a year for three years - so there is a lot of sustainability. The network and partnership between the partners will be strengthened. The students increase their knowledge of the culture of other nations - so they can easily travel to other countries, also as an employee. The students increase their own competences for natural science and social skills, so they will be interesting for employers. The students and all participants will find out the European ideas and will be interested for the E.U. and for political activities and engagement. So there is a big value for Europe. Because more than 300 participants will take part in the project. \r\nTo realize this aims formal (school) and non-formal partners will work together for three years. Most of the pupils use a foreign language and all participants will meet others from a different cultural background. So the participants will be sensible European citizens.", "http://www.carnforthhigh.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE03-KA201-001612_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LA5"}
