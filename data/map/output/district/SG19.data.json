The project will build an initial operating capacity for a European Environment Earth Observation System in the three strategic areas of Drought, Forestry and Biodiversity. It will then undertakes the research necessary to develop this further into and advanced operating capacity that provides access not just to data but also to analytical models made understandable and useable by scientists from different disciplinary domains. This concept of inter-disciplinary interoperability requires research in advanced modelling from multi-scale heterogeneous data sources, expressing models as workflows of geo-processing components reusable by other communities, and ability to use natural language to interface with the models. The extension of INSPIRE and GEOSS components with concepts emerging in the Web 2.0 communities in respect to user interactions and resource discovery, also supports the wider engagement of the scientific community with GEOSS as a powerful means to improve the scientific understanding of the complex mechanisms driving the changes that affect our planet.", 123774.0, 6850179.0, "EUROGEOSS", "A better 'system of systems' for the environment", "Environmental monitoring and assessment has been upgraded, thanks to an initiative that ensures interoperability between all relevant systems.", "The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) was designed by the world's eight most industrialised countries (G-8) to bring together all the planet's monitoring efforts to address environmental concerns.\n\nSince GEOSS is a 'system of systems' that deals with the environment, all its components must be interoperable and be able to communicate together seamlessly. The EU-funded project 'European approach to GEOSS' (Eurogeoss) was launched to enhance scientific exchange among the different systems. It has achieved this based on the concept of inter-disciplinary interoperability which highlights the complex relations between environment and society.\n\nThe project has underlined the benefits of an interoperable system, in conjunction as well with the European Inspire Directive, which represents an infrastructure for spatial information across the continent. Eurogeoss focuses on the three strategic areas of drought, forestry and biodiversity, producing data and analytical models that scientists from different fields could exploit.\n\nIn parallel, the new system incorporates Web 2.0 technology communities to foster interaction and availability of resources, encouraging dialogue between science and society. This is vital for raising awareness and building consensus on how to tackle global environmental challenges.\n\nEurogeoss has succeeded in establishing its most important objective, namely robust databases regarding biodiversity, drought and forestry. It has also built a framework of surveys and models to assess the long-term impact of the project and the benefits of GEOSS. The project extended advanced operating capabilities to access not only data on different environment-related topics but models and analytical processes to help researchers and stakeholders through a web-based platform.
