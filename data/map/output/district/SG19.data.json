The project will build an initial operating capacity for a European Environment Earth Observation System in the three strategic areas of Drought, Forestry and Biodiversity. It will then undertakes the research necessary to develop this further into and advanced operating capacity that provides access not just to data but also to analytical models made understandable and useable by scientists from different disciplinary domains. This concept of inter-disciplinary interoperability requires research in advanced modelling from multi-scale heterogeneous data sources, expressing models as workflows of geo-processing components reusable by other communities, and ability to use natural language to interface with the models. The extension of INSPIRE and GEOSS components with concepts emerging in the Web 2.0 communities in respect to user interactions and resource discovery, also supports the wider engagement of the scientific community with GEOSS as a powerful means to improve the scientific understanding of the complex mechanisms driving the changes that affect our planet.", 123774.0, 6850179.0, "EUROGEOSS", "A better 'system of systems' for the environment", "Environmental monitoring and assessment has been upgraded, thanks to an initiative that ensures interoperability between all relevant systems.", "The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) was designed by the world's eight most industrialised countries (G-8) to bring together all the planet's monitoring efforts to address environmental concerns.\n\nSince GEOSS is a 'system of systems' that deals with the environment, all its components must be interoperable and be able to communicate together seamlessly. The EU-funded project 'European approach to GEOSS' (Eurogeoss) was launched to enhance scientific exchange among the different systems. It has achieved this based on the concept of inter-disciplinary interoperability which highlights the complex relations between environment and society.\n\nThe project has underlined the benefits of an interoperable system, in conjunction as well with the European Inspire Directive, which represents an infrastructure for spatial information across the continent. Eurogeoss focuses on the three strategic areas of drought, forestry and biodiversity, producing data and analytical models that scientists from different fields could exploit.\n\nIn parallel, the new system incorporates Web 2.0 technology communities to foster interaction and availability of resources, encouraging dialogue between science and society. This is vital for raising awareness and building consensus on how to tackle global environmental challenges.\n\nEurogeoss has succeeded in establishing its most important objective, namely robust databases regarding biodiversity, drought and forestry. It has also built a framework of surveys and models to assess the long-term impact of the project and the benefits of GEOSS. The project extended advanced operating capabilities to access not only data on different environment-related topics but models and analytical processes to help researchers and stakeholders through a web-based platform.

ARCH programmes have seen over 1,000 learners from a wide range of government and non-governmental organisations within Scotland visit a variety countries within Europe to learn about the different ways in which new skills and competencies in nature conservation and cultural heritage interpretation can be delivered.  \r\nNature Exchange Two (NET) aims to provide adult learner participants with a focused, ready-made opportunity to take time out from their every-day work to learn about how conservation, education and interpretation work is undertaken elsewhere in Europe and give them an opportunity to consider new ways of working.  \r\nNET  will collaborate with partners throughout Europe from Iceland and Norway in the north to Cyprus and Bulgaria in the south. The aim is to develop knowledge exchange trips (typically of 8-10 days) that focus on the management of our natural and cultural heritage.  NET is developed around the priority areas of work within natural and cultural heritage, conservation interpretation and education in Scotland today.  Each training visit will be associated with a broad theme, which will provide a focus for activities through the week.  Emphasis will be placed on exchange of knowledge, ideas, issues and solutions between the participants and hosts. Informal talks by participants on their work in Scotland and challenges they face, as well as talks from the hosts, encouraging focused discussion on how both participants and hosts can benefit from each other\u2019s knowledge and experiences and how they can  build this into ongoing adult education courses.  \r\nAs in previous years, we will work with our partners to develop adult education training placements, which focus on new skills and knowledge and have the capacity for the exchange of best practice that fits with participants needs. For example in Germany the programme will focus on the wildcat and on preserving and managing its habitat, In Iceland the focus will be interpretive techniques for understanding and conserving the cultural landscape, including the traditional skills of turf building. In Finland and Slovakia the programme theme is forest schools and environmental education.  In Norway the themes are large mammal management, fishery management, predator control and balancing hunting and conservation interests.\r\nOur partners all  share our aim of providing high quality and innovative vocational training.  Receiving partners have been chosen because they are recognised by the UK consortium as being able to provide examples of best practice in the key areas identified as most important for our Scottish practitioners to learn. What they offer has the potential to be built into adult education, both formal and informal. \r\nNET participants will be drawn from the 14 member organisations in the ARCH mobility consortium which includes Scottish Natural Heritage, RSPB, National Trust for Scotland, Forestry Commision Scotland  and John Muir Trust all of whom have a remit to manage and protect Scotland\u2019s natural and cultural heritage through conservation, interpretation and education.  The ARCH consortium will positively encourage those from the more remote areas of Scotland to participate in NET through a publicity and dissemination campaign Our natural and cultural heritage plays a \u201ckey part in promoting a Scottish identity internationally and is a topic appropriate for developing European inter-regional co-operation\u201d  Establishing links and alliances with international organisations and regions and countries are long term strategies where effort needs to be prioritised.\u201d NET addresses this priority.", "http://www.rspb.org.uk", "The Firm of ARCH", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA104-000078_14"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2DL", "ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OFBIRDS ROYAL CHARTER*RSPB", 1994.0, "Other management expenditure (05.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_16881", 2016], ["2DL", "ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OFBIRDS ROYAL CHARTER*RSPB", 750071.0, "Halting and reversing biodiversity loss (07.02.02)", "fts_2016_20012", 2016], ["2DL", "ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OFBIRDS ROYAL CHARTER*RSPB", 132366.0, "Supporting better environmental governance and information at all levels (07.02.03)", "fts_2016_37594", 2016], ["2DL", "ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OFBIRDS ROYAL CHARTER*RSPB", 464.0, "Support expenditure for the Cohesion Fund (13.01.04.03)", "fts_2016_46007", 2016], ["2HA", "FOUNDATION FOR INFORMATION POLICY RESEARCH", 12178.0, "Scientific and technical support for Union policies on a competitive basis (10.04.03)", "fts_2016_71507", 2016], ["2DL", "ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OFBIRDS ROYAL CHARTER*RSPB", 273758.0, "Halting and reversing biodiversity loss (07.02.02)", "fts_2017_9380", 2017], ["2DL", "ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OFBIRDS ROYAL CHARTER*RSPB", 329.0, "Other management expenditure (05.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_18686", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "SG19"}
