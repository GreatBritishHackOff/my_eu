Volunteers will develop their professional skills and knowledge as well as their intercultural experience. Each RO is involved in activities that benefit local communities, so volunteers will be directly aiding these communities with their service.\r\n\r\nThe project is designed to meet the following objectives:   \r\n1) Challenge young people to become actively involved in society by \u2018being there\u2019 and caring for others, especially those on the edge of society\r\n2) Give the volunteer new skills and work experience through volunteering\r\n3) Develop the volunteer\u2019s capacity to work, and/or live in, groups/teams\r\n4) Get to know the British culture, people and language \u2018from the inside\u2019\r\n5) Promote intercultural dialogue between young people (in the volunteer group, but also in the local community of which the volunteer is part)\r\n6) Challenge the volunteer to reflect critically on his/her spirituality and be open to other religions & ways of life\r\n7) Benefit the Receiving Organisation with the enthusiasm and cross cultural experience of a volunteer, who is able to augment the work of paid staff members with energy, new perspectives and time to build relationships with the community/ client group being served. \r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that this project will involve 20 volunteers, who will have a range of socio-economic backgrounds. TfG encourage participation from volunteers who may otherwise struggle to access opportunities for higher education or work experience, whether this is due to geographical reasons, health problems, or economic obstacles. It is anticipated that the project will be accessed by both male and female volunteers. \r\n\r\nThe specific tasks of a volunteer will vary with the different ROs, but all will involve an element of service to others, and all volunteers will be given comprehensive training and ongoing support and supervision to help them manage the challenges of this type of work. \r\n\r\nSeveral methods (including the Youthpass tool and various TfG-created documents) will be used to monitor the success of the project and gain feedback on the learning achieved by the participants.", "http://www.morleycommunitychurch.org.uk", "Time For God", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-036071_12"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WF3"}
