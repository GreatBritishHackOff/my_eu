Many factors influence urban security, from the physical layout to the social and economic makeup of urban zones, from the political and economic landscape on a national level to the daily practices of public services that are active in the area. Seemingly unrelated events may trigger sudden escalation of unrest in neighbourhoods that have been under social tension for a prolonged period of time. Europe has seen many severe instances of urban unrest in recent times, but also the rapid expansion of new urban environments, and new types of communities due to migration, economic tension and social developments. These developments demand a better understanding of urban security throughout Europe, and more sensible policy development to create safer urban environments, and prevent undesirable security scenarios.\n\n\n\nPolicy makers need to know and understand which factors directly or indirectly impact urban security and safety. This includes an appreciation of security status (such as threat levels and potential for crime) as well as public perception of safety and security. A failure by policy makers to timely recognise and mitigate such threats may allow unrest to develop, and consequently affect the prosperity and functionality of the area. Policy makers need to become aware of the interdependency of factors, and define policy based on that comprehension. However, in reality, most decisions are made on the basis of local, long-standing best practices. Given the universal importance of urban security, it is vital to share knowledge and practices among stakeholders throughout Europe, and to jointly work on a common understanding of urban security.\n\n\n\nThe project \u2018Best practice Enhancers for Security in Urban Regions\u2019 (BESECURE) will work towards a better understanding of urban security through examination of different European urban areas. By examining 8 urban areas throughout Europe, BESECURE will build a comprehensive and pragmatic set of indicators, and a pragmatic risk assessment model that can provide cues about the development of certain scenarios. BESECURE will improve urban security policy making by sharing best practices that are in use throughout Europe, and by providing visualisation and assessment tools and guidelines that will help local policy makers to assess the impact of their practices, and improve their decision making.", 130264.0, 3525343.0, "BESECURE", "Best practices for urban security", "Policymakers are being given the right tools to help foster more secure urban environments.", "Urban security in Europe is a crucial process that also varies from country to country in terms of both approach and focus.

The initiative seeks to support local policymakers in their efforts to heighten and apply advanced urban zone security measures.\n\nThe project identified a need for finding and handling the primary symptoms that impact urban security in order to prevent any escalation in threatening scenarios. Utilising a best practice approach by combining interlinked datasets to function as a warning system is the most effective method to cover all needs across countries. BESECURE groups its four main objectives in the categories knowledge, understand, develop and transfer, which appropriately describes the pattern of what achieving urban security entails.\n\nWhen policymakers have the right tools based on background material as well as innovative data, they can create the appropriate policies to effectively instil measures of urban security. Thus, key project activities involve not only research but also the creation of a support tool and eight case studies in order to arrive at an integrated policy design support platform.\n\nA prototype of the platform has been created and this has propelled the internal project development plan.

With half of the world\u2019s population currently living in urban centres, and with this figure set to increase to two-thirds by 2050, the issue of security and citizen safety is of paramount importance and a growing concern. In view of the growing number of threats from global terrorism, natural disasters or crime, urban planning practice must incorporate appropriate security measures for vulnerability identification and resilience enhancements.\nUrban planning is a process involving numerous stakeholders and multi-disciplinary teams. Although the use of software tools plays a significant role in this complex process, yet, none exist that take into consideration the security (and connected safety) aspects of urban planning as a whole.\nUrban planning teams need tools that fully encompass the pre-application process with developers/designers, and facilitate flexible solutions, not imposed measures. The objective of VITRUV is the development of software tools for the long and complex screening process, which is urban planning, moving across three levels from concept to plan to detail design. Based on an all hazard risk approach, the tools will enable planners\n\u2022 to make well-considered systematic qualitative decisions (concept level),\n\u2022 to analyse the susceptibility of urban spaces (e.g. building types, squares, public transport, and their functionalities) with respect to new threats (plan level), and\n\u2022 to perform vulnerability analyses of urban spaces by computing the likely damage on individuals, buildings, traffic infrastructure (detail level).\nAll levels (concept, plan and detail) will contribute to enabling the development of more robust and resilient space in the field of urban (re)planning/(re)design/(re)engineering. Planners who use VITRUV\u2019s tools will be able to deliver urban space less prone to and less affected by attacks and disasters, thus sustainably improving the security of citizens", 158225.0, 3800321.0, "VITRUV", "High-tech urban planning fosters security", "New software tools now under development are set to support urban planners and government officials in enhancing security across European towns and cities.", "A high standard of living depends to a large extent on a safe and secure urban environment, representing a vision that the EU is eager to realise in all its cities. The EU-funded project 'Vulnerability identification tools for resilience enhancements of urban environments' (VITRUV) is developing software tools for urban planners to further the viability of urban projects, designs and concepts. In particular, a set of Internet-compatible tools is assisting urban planners and city administrators to assess security weaknesses and propose solutions, rendering the urban environment much more resilient.\n\nThe software in question is framing urban security issues in relation to urban planners' decisions regarding spaces, including economic, ethical, social, safety and mobility considerations. Such threats could include the use of explosives, biological agents or chemical attacks. The solution involves outlining tools, methods and best practices for improved urban planning and assessment based on advanced algorithms that help identify specific urban security vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.\n\nIn more technical terms, the computer-based tool employs automated empirical and semi-quantitative risk analysis (ERA) based on database analysis and expert judgment. It also applies automated quantitative risk analysis (QRA) that examines location, building types, structural elements and load-bearing considerations, factoring in vulnerability analysis as well. The toolset comprises a 3D graphic user interface that offers resilience enhancement measures and their costs, enabling full 3D visualisation of urban planning scenarios, analysis input and results.\n\nAlready, the project team has developed preliminary versions of the ERA module and for quantitative modules covering explosive, biological and chemical threats. It conducted urban case studies across urban environments in Denmark, Italy and the United Kingdom.\n\nMore specifically, three valuable tools are expected to emerge from the project. The first is a concept-level tool supporting risk assessment, a knowledge base and recommendations to further analyse specific risks. The second is a planning-level tool that offers susceptibility analysis of infrastructure, vulnerability analysis of consequences after an event, and identification of hotspots at risk. Last is a detail-level tool that can also be used for susceptibility analysis to cover finer details such as inaccessibility of streets, as well as quantify potential damage to buildings and people. It can also estimate disruption to traffic and identify vulnerable areas or buildings, in addition to helping enhance resilience such as through the replacement or upgrading of specific infrastructure components. More about these tools can be found on the http://www.vitruv-project.eu/ (project website) . Much progress has been achieved on many other fronts, including a draft version of the knowledge base.\n\nOverall, VITRUV stands to enhance urban planning by integrating security and safety considerations, improving policymaking and accountability as well. These tools will help build urban areas that have less crime, social instability and even terrorism.
