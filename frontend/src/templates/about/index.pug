    h1 About MyEU

    p The UK Government will spend about #[a(href='https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/autumn-budget-2017-documents/autumn-budget-2017') Â£809 billion] this year, and <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/articles/theukcontributiontotheeubudget/2017-10-31">less than 2%</a> of this goes to the EU. We wondered what impact that spending was having in the UK, and this map was an attempt to see.

    p This isn't a complete list - we know that there are data sources and projects we haven't captured yet. Got something that should be on the map? <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFuSkjkvuXWX70mHJJJrQlU4Ew6GKGd2XFLzGmZGLZbvFKfw/viewform?usp=sf_link">Get in touch</a>.

    h2 Data and Methodology

    p The map uses the following datasets:

    p European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) 2014-2020. ESIF includes money from the European Social Fund (ESF), European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). We got this data from separate datasets for #[a(href='https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-structural-and-investment-funds-useful-resources') England], #[a(href='https://beta.gov.scot/publications/esif-operations-funding/') Scotland], #[a(href='https://gov.wales/funding/eu-funds/2014-2020/approved-projects/?lang=en') Wales] and #[a(href='https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/esf') Northern Ireland].

    p All funding direct from the  EU budget centrally administered by the Commission from 2017 and 2016 from the #[a(href='http://ec.europa.eu/budget/fts/index_en.htm') Financial Transparency system]

    p #[a(href='http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/projects/') Creative Europe] funding 2014-2020, which is the EU's programme for support for cultural and audiovisual funding.

    p Projects funded by the European Union under the #[a(href='https://data.europa.eu/euodp/data/dataset/cordisfp7projects') seventh framework programme for research and technological development (FP7)] from 2007 to 2013 from  the EU Open data portal.

    p Common Agricultural Policy Funding #[a(href='http://data.nicva.org/dataset/common-agricultural-policy-cap-payments/resource/06307dc0-4dcb-4305-a3e2-a8fdeb2a2a25') data from 2015].

    h2 What action can I take?

    p If you're interested in taking action off the back of this dataset, one thing you can do is email your MP to tell them your feelings. Emailing your MP can really help. Have a look at #[a(href='https://www.writetothem.com/') Write to them] for your MP's details.
